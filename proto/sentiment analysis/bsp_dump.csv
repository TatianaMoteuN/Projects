case_Y5a0YqvFPzcpylJ	The Eastwest bank hasn’t provided ALL information I needed which are urgent and there is no possible way of getting a prompt response from them since their hotlines are not being attended to nor their emails. They said they tried calling me but I never got any call from them and I explicitly told them to send an email with information LINE by LINE for every questions to avoid getting back and forth and also so I don’t need to contact another department which is pretty impossible with their customer service. Here’s my questions left unanswered by them for 6 months!  1. Why my principal balance as of February 25,2021 is 86183.28? My monthly amortization is only around P16300, so for 5months(February to June) it should only be P81500. Why is it P86183.28 then?  2. What is the late payment charges for? I have the receipts that I've on time except for that one time I forgot because it was due 1 year later but I already made the payment for that.Bayanihan also says that there should be no late payment charges, therefore, this is not for the 2 months I didn’t pay. What is this late payment for then?  3. Until when do I need to pay monthly amortization? I think my maturity date is June 26,2021 because of the Bayanihan.   4. I have already paid my amortization for May and June today. I don’t know how long will it reflect in your system. How much more do I have to pay after these 2 payments? Send my updated SOA considering that you have received my payments for May and June.  5. Once I have paid the balance in SOA, how will i know if I still have remaining balance?  6. I have continued insurance on my car, why do I have a penalty?  Please read everything and provide the information for everything that is highlighted in red.

case_Kh44usiL8J39OrR	My complain is regarding PNB Las Pinas City Hall branch, I was told that I cant withdraw over the counter using my ATM account and have to use the ATM machine, as to protect my ATM as much as possible I dont use the ATM machine as I have already bad previous experience in using PNB ATM machines like blocking, card was not returned and etc. mostly resorted to replacement which usually takes about 2 weeks. Now this branch told me that I cant withdraw over the counter coz its their policy for ATM cards to withdraw on ATM machines or unless i would withdraw beyond the 50k limit, this is clearly a very unfair practice coz once something would happen to my card again they never inform you just get surprised and would not even compensate for all the hustle and have to wait for a few weeks again for replacement. Hoping for a decisive action from BSP on this matter

case_VuhwlGPyKGSc4JN	I applied credit card at Eastwest Bank last March 2021 and was delighted with the notification from them that my application was approved. They said that my card was in transit and I patiently waited for the arrival until the courier from Mindanao area called me for delivery I was surprised because on the first place my address is not in Mindanao. I dont know why the card was addressed to Mindanao. Eastwest told me that I need to submit documents for correction of my billing address, so it was corrected. However, as per courier, my address is out of scope, so Eastwest suggested for a BRANCH PICK UP arrangement, and according to them, I need to coordinate with the bank for approval of branch pick up. I initiated to open an account with the branch to have record with them and also to facilitate the approval of my request. My request for branch pick up was approved by the branch. I called the branch after two weeks to ask about the arrival of my card for pick up, they said, they have not received it yet. I called Eastwest CS today May 5, 2020, and I was told that the type of card I was approved cannot be delivered or arranged for branch pick up.  My concern is, if on the first place, it cannot be arranged for branch pick up, they should have said so, so that my effort was not wasted. Second, they should have informed me about the status of my card delivery especially when they realized that it could not be sent for branch pick up.\nI know having approved for a credit card is a privilege, rather than a right of a client.\nAs an appeal please revisit your policies especially in card delivery. Kahit manlang tracking number sana ay maibigay sa amin gaya ng ibang banks para mas mapadali ang delivery.

case_wb1jiusT2f2n4LA	I send out my savings from my Union Bank account  going to my BDO account via PesoNet last April 3, 2021 and it falls on Saturday. I am fully aware that PesoNet have their cut off and since the fund was transferred on the off work hour, I know that the transaction will be processed on the next banking hours, so I am expecting my fund it's either by Monday or Tuesday. I am confident that in the right time I can use it to sustain my upcoming financial obligation just like what I used to before together with my respective bank institution. The hilarious thing came out on Tuesday April 6, 2021 because upon checking my Online banking with BDO my expected transferred money is still not posted on my account. I called first the BDO since I have my e-mail notification from Union Bank that I successfully transferred the money to BDO but they never failed to informed me regarding with the posting time of the amount to other bank institution due to different time of cut off in receiving and posting transferred fund via PesoNet. And then I speak with to BDO asking where is my fund? They told me that they will go on investigation since on their end the transaction with my account is not showing on my account. I provided my reference number to them where I got from my e-mail receipt with my Union Bank account. And they advise me to reach out Union Bank regarding with my concern as well. That I willingly oblige. And the representative ask me to give them 3 working days to investigate what happen to my fund also they will keep me posted in any updates. Same day I reach out with Union Bank via e-mail regarding to what happened. They told me the transaction is successful which I completely accept since I have my written evidence on hand to provide that I made a transaction on that day with the acknowledgement of Union Bank through mail. I waited for 3 days with BDO to send me an update. They did, but only to say that the transaction is unsuccessful. And try to contact Union Bank. Right away I send an email with Union Bank and stating what I have got from BDO. The worst part is I only got a reply with Union Bank saying that my case is Tagged as Resolved. I asked them How? When? And where did the happen? After getting a automated thank you reply for reaching out to them I have none. And this is really frustrating since I am just like an ordinary citizens now a days who lost their work due to pandemic crisis and I need to pay my bills using that not too much to give amount from my past hard earnings. I don't know where I am going to withdraw my money. I have my receipt as acknowledgement of my transaction but I do not have any proof of acknowledgement that my fund was already received by my beneficiary bank institution. Please help me with this because as a single mom of two and one of them is a special child it's kinda hard to accept that just like that I need to passed this on as if that money is not belong to me.

case_QTorkVRuP69iAWf	Formal Complaint Against BPI San Bartolome Branch \n\nTo Whom It May Concern, \n\nThis is a formal complaint against BPI San Bartolome Branch and its bank personnel. \n\nI had the worst account opening and customer service experience, to the point that I no longer want to continue my relationship with BPI. \n\nOn March 8, my mother and I went to BPI San Bartolome Branch to open a joint account that for our family savings. \n\nWe patiently waited for our turn outside the branch, under the scorching heat, for more than an hour. \n\nWhen we finally entered the branch, we had to wait for more than an hour again only to be provided with the worst customer service there is. \n\nWe provided all the requirements they asked for. I even gave 3 government IDs, copy of my company ID, copy of my payslip, proof of billing, and the list goes on. \n\nMs. Ruth R. Jumao-as, the Unipro who attended to us said we cannot open an account because I need to have my physical company ID as a "proof of income". Since when did a company ID became a proof of income? After talking to the Assistant Branch Manager Michael P. Banzon, they finally "allowed" us to open an account. As if it's our privilege that we opened an account with BPI. Ms. Jumao-as even asked me to send a copy of my company ID via SHAREit app so they can proceed with the account opening. Is SHAREit a valid and safe way to get client personal information/IDs? Does that comply with Philippine banking rules and regulations?\nAfter a long excrutiating process, the account was opened. \n\nToday, I went back to the branch, as this is the only available time for me, to collect our ATM cards. My mother wrote an authorization letter and provided her original IDs so I can collect her ATM card on her behalf since it is ECQ and senior citizens, which are part of the high risk sectors, are discouraged by the government to go outside. \n\nI was then told by the Mr. Banzon that they will not honor the authorization letter and my mother have to personally appear at the branch. I told them that I had to collect the ATM card for her for the obvious reasons. It's ECQ for goodness sake! It is a joint account as well. I was then asked by Mr. Banzon why did my mother open an account if she will not be able to go out and get the ATM card herself? I felt really discriminated. It was obvious discrimination of the elderly. I then asked him to show me a copy of their protocol or at least an advice in any form of document stating that they do not honor authorization letters even during the peak of this pandemic. He utterly refused. He asked if we have a car so my mother can personally go to the branch despite government advice for seniors to stay at home. \n\nMy mother was able to collect my ATM card on my behalf from the same branch 2 years ago so how come they didn't allow it this time? Is this just a mere show of power, discrimination and complete disregard of ECQ guidelines? \n\nWill BPI shoulder the cost of hospital bills should my mother fell ill due to Covid-19 because they insisted that she had to go out and personally appear at the branch during ECQ? Why did Mr. Banzon asked why did my mother opened an account if she cannot go out? Is BPI allowing the discrimination of the elderly? \n\nI'm sending this as a formal complaint and would like to get a letter of explanation from BPI Head Office and an apology letter from the Branch Manager, Mr. Banzon and Ms. Jumao-as of BPI San Bartolome Branch.

case_G4OG2GTU5SI9HlD	The name of the bank is PR Savings Bank in Aurora Isabela. I think it is now bought or under City Savings Bank. My parents were co makers of a loan from my uncle. Mu uncle died last year and we found out that he did not pay the said loan and it is now passed to my parents. The principal amount was 285k with an interest of 36%. I just want to ask if this is excessive? We tried to settle the loan with the bank managers involve and each we present the amount agreed they would ask for additional since it wasnot approved by the board. The total amount of the is now 1.7 million and the default date was dec 2013. We manage to raise 800k but per the last conversation which is verbal, we still need to provide 285k for the principal. Per my knowledge regarding partial payment, it should be applied to the principal first right? Or I must be wrong. What steps should we take next? Our family home was the collateral of the loan and they keep on telling us that it would foreclosed if we wont pay. Thank you

case_HeesdiM7a6z3Ifw	RCBC Bankard Credit Cards - this pandemic season they've been charging me late charge and interest fees even if I pay the same day as the due date. I understand online payment takes credit after 2-3 days. However, in this pandemic season that is the only mode of payment I can do as I cannot go to banks personally due to Covid. Of all the banks, they are the only which is inconsiderate in this kind of situation. Other banks acknowledge payment date = due date even if it was an online payment. Can you help me on this? Because we are all struggling this pandemic season. And I am also having financial problems. I just recovered from covid too. But what's important is that I am paying my credit card bills with total payment due on exact due date even if it is online. Please help.

case_NN3IS6yhOGIEHpu	Hi, my name is Sheen Villar. I made a non fraud dispute claim to my debit card's issuing bank: SecurityBank. I complied with the needed document last Jan. 18, was told that the reversal of the pending authorization charge will be processed 50 calendar days upon receipt of the document and the email correspondence I've sent them. I have a made a follow up on Mar. 11th and was advised that the disputed transaction is still on process, that they've made a follow up with the concerned unit but haven't heard since then. The amount is only less than a thousand peso, considering that it is still pandemic and definitely my fault, that is why I decided to seek help from you in order for the bank to possibly speed up the process of this dispute I filed 2 months ago. My email is shin_gun26@yahoo.com, SecurityBank reference number: 02392855. Thank you

case_x0mWvJEuUxiFDJT	Eastwest Bank prematurely closed my complaint without offering CONCRETE action plan or resolution. Just barely two hours after receiving their response, another collector showed up on our house. They did not do something about my complaint but instead prepared a sugarcoat response, half-truth at that. Those collectors do not come to our house to "assess" but rather "remind" me of my payment which will resume in July. I also noted that the collectors came from different collecting agencies. The reason why EASTWEST could not stop this is that they have already distributed my information to different agencies, which I DID NOT AUTHORIZE. My right to data privacy may have been compromised by EASTWEST BANK in this situation.

case_ocZPc8IHWNmYfWd	This complaint is just an additional information with the first i filed last night March 26 around 10:30 pm. I forgot to screenshot my complaint transaction and i also for forgot to describe my complaint. Allow me to narrate really what happened. February 26, an agent of Metrobank Credit Card Corporation by the name of Joseph offered a cash to go loan of P150,000.00 with a low rate of .58%. At the start i was hesitant because first we have an existing cash to go loan and 2nd, i told him i ca't decide for now, i have to ask the approval of my wife when i go home because at that time i was at my office. and to make the long story short, at the end he got my YES because he assured me that even if approved i can still cancel if i want. He even said i can use that loan to pay my existing loan and othe financial obligation. He also got my AUB Bank account number. We talked for almost 45 minutes. He didn't explain to me well that if approved and if i cancel the said loan i will pay a termination fee of 5% . When i got home i shared to my wife about this and she said NO, We need to finish the existing one since 9 months more lto pay. Yes, we have an existing loan. We are paying P15,070.03 a month for almost 27 months already. Going back , Feb 27 in the morning, i received an SMS message from Metrobank informing me i was declined from my request of loan. So, i was happy because wish granted since that is also my wife's decision. But when called the Metrobank in the afternoon, they said that transaction push through and that if cancel i will pay a termination fee of 5% of P150,000.00. She suggested that i will file a complaint against that agent and thats what i did. But when i received my statement of account this March 25, they already billed that loan. I never received that 150,000 loan because i have closed my AUB account last March 1, that is 2 days after i called Metrobank to cancel my loan. I closed my AUB account because that's only the solution i know so that the loan cant be deposited at my account. I also checked during that time if there's 150,000.00 but AUB said none. so i closed it. Pls help me with this problem i have that Metrobank created. IIt was really stressful. HIndi po ako nakakatulog ng maayos dahil lang dito. Sana kung maganda ang intensyon ng Metrobank, sana tinawagan ako after nakausap ko yung agent nila just to confirm. Pero wlang follow-up na nangyayari instead i received a message from them declining my loan request. Hope BSP will take action on this issue. Salamat po and God bless po.

case_0OmLWQ1cd6OThRk	Good day! I am Mr. Lhorence Narral Reyes a customer of Toyota Financial Services Philippines . I have an existing account to them with monthly amortization of 14,745.00 due on every 1st of the month. At present even before, I am paying religiously my monthly amortization if not on time with some delay on days within the month making sure its updated monthly. Last year i availed of the moratorium I for the month of MAY & June 2020 since i already paid month of april 2020. And with the Bayanihan LAw 2. I again applied for moratorium of loan payment for October and November 2020 by calling the hotline of TFSPH since i am from Aklan and they are based in NCR. As i understood and discussed by them i need to pay accrued interest that can be settled on December 2020 or at the end of my term of loan and my original loan term will be extended for a total of 4 months(which covers the moratorium) However toyota today in the billing statement stated that i have a PAST DUE account with two months of past due payment referring to October and November 2020and bearing late payment penalty. They even refer my account to the law office since for them i have a past due account because as i understood they are now collecting that OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2020 PAYMENT FROM me which i repute due to availment of moratorium..May i ask advice and assistance from your office on what to do since my account was laso referred to law office for collection or hahatakin po nila ang sasakyan ko.

Me and my husband stay abroad and we always fund our bank account to avoid penalties and additional interests.

This has been reported to them the day the very first day that transactions were made from my card --- I was informed because I received an SMS from the bank that they rejected one transaction because it reached my credit limit. I immediately called the bank (February 11 2021) and there I was informed that there were charges made to my credit card. I informed them that these are not valid and they processed card replacement immediately. Until now they are still investigating these unauthorized transaction and they are charging my card with finance charge because I did not pay for these unauthorized transactions and these unauthorized transaction are still included in the billing. There are already 2 billing cycles and until now they do not adjust it. Hope you can enlighten me with this. Thank you. This is a complaint against Metrobank

case_em3yi6vf3dVfKVV	Bdo \n \nGood day. I am writing to you to seek assistance concerning my BDO Auto Loan. On March 7, 2021. As per my sister (Since I am at work) a collection agency representative dropped by at our residence and introduce himself that he will be the one who will collect the unpaid balance amounting to Php 200,000.00, and discuss the interest and penalty and the consequence for the said loan if I will not be going to pay and gave his contact number.\n \n I would like to raise the ff concerns:\n \n1.      No Official Letter from them regarding the status of my Loan (SOA), No feedback from my email last October 28, 2020, and lastly No Notification that my account was endorsed to the Third Party.\n2.      Discussing the details of my Loan with my sister violating my Data Privacy Act ( I have to apologize, my sister are currently suffering from cancer and additional stress will not help her condition by hearing the details of this situation from collection agency representative )\n \nTo discuss further, On March 8-9, 2021, I contacted the BDO Customer Service Hotline and coordinate the details of my loan status. I was informed that their Account Officer will call me and wait for 3 working days to process my request. Bothered by the situation on March 10, 2021, at 1:30 pm I was able to talk to one of their customers representative Joven and informed me that he can endorse me right away to the Account Officer since from their system my account is still with them. I was instructed to call directly to Janice Yandoc, with a couple of attempts fortunately I was able to talk to Yandoc. She informed me that our account was already endorsed to the collection agency, I told her your customer representative told me that my account is still in the system, she bluntly answered “Hindi updated ang system namin pero wala na yun”. I asked her again, where is the formal letter? She told me that they already sent the letter, which I made clear I did not receive any letter. With hostility, she answered me again “ Baka nauna lang yung collection agency sa sulat, pero lahat pinadalhan namin, kaya nga alam ng collection agency yung bahay niyo”.  I also asked her, what about the letter I sent last October 2020 requesting for restructure payment I did not receive any feedback from you, she replied, - wala wala ng yung email na yun July pa yun!. With humility, I tried again if there is any way I can coordinate with them for the possible options, and told me wala na kaming magagawa diyan coordinate directly with a collection agency.\n \nAttached herewith the photo of the supporting documents for your reference.\n\n1. Loan details ( Details from BDO Online wit no complete details)\n2. Proof of my last Payment\n3. Email letter\n \nI was a good payer from the year 2017 (July), 2018, 2019, and early year of 2020, Until the pandemic crisis began my income was hugely reduced and lead me to my financial difficulties and prioritizing our living expense, since both of my senior parents are with me ( 83 years old) , including my sister with lymphoma cancer.\n \nI prefer to deal with BDO directly and not to collection agencies. I intend to pay the remaining balance as long as that the penalties and interests will be waived. I hope they find this acceptable.\n \nThank you for taking the time in reading my letter and looking forward that you can help me on this matter and if you have any further questions you may reach me at mobile number 09177532911.\n \nGod Bless.\n \nSincerely Yours,\n \nArleen F.

case_VEao998wWCSdqfZ	Rcbcbankard called me last feb24,2021 they offered me a loan they process it (its available in my account) processing is 7-10 days. I followed up thru calling their hotline last mar10 i asked if it is sure loan their agent say yes wait until today mar12. I followed up again today their agent say its declined. I was a good payer for almost 15yrs of rcbc bankard holder only this pandemic i cant pay the exact due but still i managed to settled my due (but not in full). As far as i know you allowed all credit cards company to avail a loan not to decline loan for their consumer. I just want to pay my unpaid due to avoid lots of interest the only solution is to get a loan. Hope for your kind consideration. Thank you

case_6BNfhPeRVuebPRp	Citibank lowered my ca without my knowledge which resulted to voluntary cancellation of my card. Without hesitation they cancelled it which worries me. Unlike before that they valued you. I immediately requested for reinstatement that night of march 9 since i was not able to check anymore my online banking with citibank and worried that they might overcharged me. March 10 due to various call it has been activated again. Surprised to know that my installment balance was 469k vs the principal balance if settled early at 305k  called again citibank to revert back my installment to its original state which 38 mos to date or 3 years. They said cannot be. Told them that i did not understand it because i am already angry when citi officer called me. Its different when there is a physical data than listening over the phone. Citibank has no email address where you can file a complaint. All you can do is call the customer service than was not even their employee but outside provider. My request to them is to reduced the amount to principal balance since it is unfair to charged me outright for an interest that is due for the next 3 years and demanding to pay it jn full. Even i  am not past due or delinquent. Or if it cannot be back to its original monthly compute it for a shorter term installment based on the principal balance plus prevailing interest. Being a filipino and a banker too citibank is overcharging me and its so usurious nothwothstNding the current situation of pandemic. And being a good customer i dont even availed the bayanihan act or baro 2. Totally dismayed. I am not rich and i just want fair payment and treatment. Hope you can help me.

Sabi po nila ayos na daw po ang pera ko at kelangan nalang icredit ng Gcash, Gcash mastercard po kasi ang gamit ko noon pag withdraw at nakipagcoordinate na din po ako sa GCASH customer service kaso ang dahilan naman nila sakin ay makikipag coordinate daw po muna sila sa ERBI. Para pong pinagpapasahan nila ang concern ko. Gusto ko na po sanang makuha ko na agad ang pera ko dahil kailangang kailangan ko na po iyon. \n\nSalamat po.

case_SxF726XMAPcaEiJ	About coins.ph. Regarding fees for transferring BTC because it is very alarming specially for new customers like me who is trying to use BTC as investment. The amount they will send through text to validate number code for the amount your are transferring is different from the amount that will be deducted... They said the amount fees varies which I understood.. But they should show that amount when we validate it through the text msg they send.. And also it should be deducted from the total amount I was supposed to be transferring..What they they is I transfer 500 to another BTC which was the amount I confirmed. I thought what ever will be the fee will be deducted from that amount . But no.. They deduct another 1000 from my available balance which is very misleading... The fee was 1000 and the amount I supposed to transfer was only 500... Which is twice the amount I transferred.. I know this is only small amount but what more if this is big money.... I hope u should take a look this kind of process online because I felt that I was robbed online... This is like very professional online robbery... This will took the money which they will insists legal.. but in reality is very misleading the way they control their platform... Whatever the fees should be deducted only from the amount being process.. I hope you will take a look this kind of process online.. thanks so much..

Ako ay labis na nang hihinayang sa mga ibinabawas na kada sentimong aming pinag hihirapan ... At ng taong bayan .. Sana ay maaksyonan nyo ang ganitong sitwasyon at gawan ng paraang patas sa mga tao dahil hindi lahat ay kayang mag maintain ng 3000 pesos .. Napaka hirap nito sa amin ..dahil hindi lagi kami ay may ganitong halaga ... Sana ay tugunan nyo ang ganitong pang yayari .. Kawawa ang taong bayan sa milyon milyong makukuhaan ng ganitong pera khit sentimo ay pinag hihirapan ng tao kaya sana ay wag naman kuhain pa ... Lalo na at nsa pandemic tayo ngaun  ..

I submitted a report to gcash regarding the issue and up until now no RESOLUTION and the amount remain as balance on my gcredit with interest. Then, February 24, 2021 I received a Cash In worth 8,000 to my gcash wallet. This money supposedly to be transferred to my bank account to pay my monthly bill and serve as my family allowance. But, February 25, 2021 around 2am gcash wipe out 6,696.82 from my G-wallet. They deducted the balance on my g-credit plus it's interest. This is very inconvenient. And I felt robbed by Gcash repeatedly. I need the fund now but they keep telling me that they can't resolve the problem immediately. I have been following up the concern for almost two months now.  If they can't resolve this, how about me? How about my family's allowance? How about my bill? That's the only money I have but gone due to deductions and interest that gcash system's mistake.

case_O3cvnApsTbDINQs	I am a victim of phishing last June 30, 2020. Five transactions with a total of 121k has been successfully debited from my Metrobank account to Paymaya accounts. I have received the resolution of my second appeal . Still, the bank is consistent with their decision not to reverse the disputed amount. I just wonder how an OTP for  authorizing a new device, means transferring funds to another account. It should be better, if there's a separate OTP in confirming fund transfer to notify us about the transactions.

case_w95nQqTDjxp4tSe	I requested for an SIP/Credit-to-cash loan from BPI last Feb 15, 2021 amounting to 400k (118k from my regular limit and 282k from madness limit). I was told that I was pre-qualified/pre-approved to take that and it will be easy for me to get that loan as per BPI representative from Call and Branch. Feb 19, 118k was credited to my savings account (SA) and deducted from my credit line. However, I am still waiting for madness limit to be credit to my SA. Feb 24, I was informed that my madness limit loan was rejected because during the time of processing my madness limit was changed to 0 (from 282k before) and I'm not eligible for the loan anymore. I see this as a false marketing scheme for clients to take out a loan with the bank promising that they are pre-qualified/pre-approved to take out the loan and can purchase something we want because we can rely on their support but in the end they won't be allowing to take the full loan.  Now I won't be able to pool the funds I need for my purchase so I need to give up the purchase and bad thing is I still have 118k loan with BPI. I need BSP support to help fix this mess with BPI and return my madness limit to the same that was promised on Feb 15.

Due to pandemic I was not able to pay them the two month amortization and so that will be added to my loan amount and will be paid after. Now I have funded my account to pay my dues with PSBank and they did not debit the amortization on my account on date and said I did not pay my monthly amortization and added another interest to my monthly amortization. Other banks did not have this kind of interest over an interest. I am a tax payer and it seems our concerns with PSBank charges are neglected.
case_KKqggOaEjnIGRTP	Cancelled my credit card with BPI. called their hotline to inquire about release of hold out amount after cancellation. I was informed that I just need to go to any branch and request. No need to go to the main branch where I applied for credit card. I was informed that release is after 5 working days after request. Now, I went to BPI Quiapo and said that it will take 3 weeks before release of my hold out. So I don't know the exact time when I will get my money. It's very inconvenient in my part because It's my money and it's my right to get it. Why do I need to wait for 3 weeks?

case_4pWoLJM8VssUsEH	Hi. I have another concern with the same bank which is PNB. My card was blocked after I purchase an item from the US. I got an email from their fraud department informing me that my card was blocked. I called their hotline prior to that and they told me that they will be sending a new card. I got an email reply from their fraud department that the card replacement won't be necessary because they already lifted my card from being blocked. I checked my account the next day and I found out that they blocked my card. I called their customer hotline and they said they will be sending a new one and it will take within 3-5 banking days to deliver my card. I called last friday and they said it was dispatcher on Feb12. They advised me to callback today which and their agent told me that it's on transit status. I asked her the time frame and they told me it's anothet 3-5 banking days. This is just really frustrating. I also got an email saying that they cannot locate my address. I already gave them the landmark of my address and my phone number in case that they need to call me.

It involved numerous transactions but was not all cleared and reversed from my account.

Worst thing is it is accumulating interests since i am not paying the amounts charged against me due to that unauthorized transactions. They also blocked me on the usage of the credit cards that they have issued to me. Please help, it’s taking so long and yet they haven’t done any actions about it. Thank you

Bumalik kami uli sa PS Bank Makati Main Branch at nakipag usap uli sa same na tao last January 8. After the conversation nagsettle ako ng payment sa cashier nila based sa binigay nila na quotation ko po and sinunod ko po ang instruction. Pero as of today may tumawag po sa akin sa legal case na wala daw pong pumasok na settlement sa account ko. I really need po ng help. Hindi ko po alam saan lalapit.

After that po nakareceived na ko ng email sa BDO na successful daw po pag transfer ko, how come po nagtransfer ako eh nagclick lang po ako ng link at agad ko po ito nireport sa Branch of Account ko and binigay ko po details sa natanggap ko na email. And I suggest pa nga po kung pwede ako pumunta ng Union bank para ireport din ang nangyari at mahold nila ang transfer ng pera ko sa Union Bank. But unfortunately ang sabi po ni BDO ay internal nalang daw po maginvestigate kaya hindi ko nireport pero hindi naman nila ginawa ang suggestion ko.\n\nTuluyan na nilang inignore ang unauthorized transactions sa bank ko. Sobrang pinaghirapan ko ang pera ko na yun para mawala lang basta-basta napakawalang security ang website ni bdo para sa one click lang eh mawala ang pera ko. So much disappointed po.

case_gbcGyk4dZL	Dear ING, There was an RTGS transaction in euro to my account # 6409 0904 6704 amounting to 2,209.32 from Citibank Europe on January 15, 2021. You only sent me a note on January 21, 2020 thru the mobile app that you reversed the amount because you do not accept other currencies. that is already 6 days after the transaction. I have been in touch with your support team asking for the proof of reversal thru messaging and thru chat but you fail to provide the document and solution. You respond so late, your live chat is always unavailable and you only told me that the relevant team in charge is not NOT Responding. Until today, Feb 2 2020 I have NOT received the funds because Citibank Europe cannot trace where the money as I am still waiting for the proof of reversal from your end. I reached out to ING support thru message and chat for 2 weeks now but you keep on telling me to wait because the relevant team in charge is NOT RESPONDING. This is frustrating and unacceptable given the waiting time. I am only asking for the Proof of reversal or rejection so that Citibank can trace but it is not provided until now. The international remittance transaction was january 15 2020 and until now my funds are missing. Most of the time the chat is unavailable and there are times my message goes unnoticed and you only respond after 2 days or more. ING please provide me that proof of reversal document that I need. Per Citibank, they tried to contact you but there was no response from your end. In the attachment, they proved that the funds were settled with ING;  now I need the proof from your end to show that you reversed the funds. I hope your bank improves its customer response time and escalation because your service is so slow. It is even more frustrating for clients as you don't have physical branches we can go to or contact numbers we can call to talk to your representatives. I hope you can look into this case as soon as possible  and hear from you on the resolution.

Oct 2020 nakapag email po ako na e aavail ko ang bayanihan 2 pero wala po response sa akin ang account officer. November 2020 pina hold ko yung check ng Dec 1 2020 until dec 22 2020 at successful naman po na nahold ang aking check as per sabi ng account officer. January 2021  nagpatulong po ako sa isang account officer na dati na pong humawak sa account ko hanggang sa ni refer niya ako  bagong account officer na humahawak sa account ko dahil nag worry rin ako gawa ng meron ako hindi na update na 2 mos which is Dec at January dahil na home quarantine ako at hihingi ako sana ng extension para ma update ang account ko pero dito ko nalaman na hindi pala ako qualify para sa bayanihan 2 dahil may nag bounce na check noong november which is hindi ko alam na may papasok na check kasi wala naman po nag inform sa akin. ang pinaghahawakan ko lang po is yong nakausap ko na dating account officer na humawak sa account ko na ang regular payment is dec 1 2020 kaya nga po napahold ko ang dec 1 ko na check, kung na inform po sana ako ng maaga idi sana ung sept ko na check is napunduhan ko. Actually napunduhan ko naman yun ang sept check ko na account kaso lang na withdraw ko muna since na dec 1 ang balik sa regular payment. handa naman po ako at willing ma update ang account ko pero sana man lang bigyan niyo rin po ako ng enough time to settle kasi hindi rin po biro ang amount na yun lalo na sa panahon na may pandemya pa. hayaan nyo po sana na masettle ko yun ngg paunti unti ng hindi na po ma endorse pa sa buyback kasi hindi naman po yan magiging ganyan kung hindi lang sa nararanasan natin na pandemic ang tanging hiling ko lang is mabigyan nyo ako ng consideration to update my account little by little, actually may email ko ako last January 21 2021 pero wala po ako narereceive na response from the account officer. kaya humihingi po ako ng konteng konsideration at pag unawa lalo na sa panahon ngayon.

However last Dec 2020 they have deducted more than my monthly amortization and I reported it to their customer care. They said they will get back to me within 7days to resolve the issue.

Today they did the same thing again, deducted more than what is expected. They also told me previously that this is regarding ‘Bayanihan’ and I told them I never knew about ‘Bayanihan’ since my and my wife are both OFW. They never even informed me about this and we don’t even availed this grace period that they were referring to.

Today I DM'ed GrapPay Singapore in Twitter and they have said that I need to monitor my account for 24-48 hours as the issue has been resolved. My point here is why arent they using their Help Centre to respond. Second, why can't they give us the timeline of the resolution and lastly, if this is a maintenance issue why have they not informed the general public ahead.

case_zzEjg4VAqd	I have an outstanding loan with PBCOM that will mature this year. Last 2019, I had a rough situation wherein I was delayed for a couple of months but I still paid it despite the fact that I am currently experiencing financial constraint due to unforseen events. Then, last year I received a phone call from an agent of PBCOM named Sir Joel, asking me to pay for the incurred charges together with my late payment, I recorded our discussion and even ask him for many times if I paid it, magiging current na yung balance ko. Sabi niya oo, so I paid it via gcash. Tapos nakareceive ako ng isa pang phone call, regarding sa "penalties/charges" again, recorded uli ung phone call, tapos sabi ko akala ko ba ung last payment ko is for charges na, to sum it up, nagbayad uli ako. Then come late 2020, I received another phone call from a different person na taga PBCOM din, asking for payment para sa penalties sabi ko I already made the payment last time via gcash and this is the third person I spoke to regarding my account. Sabi ko pakicheck ung system, then chineck nia and by therr she apologized and informed me about my amortization na current status na. Tapos ngayon nagulat ako kasi I received an email from Ronna Salvador regarding the incurred charges cor Bayanihan 2 na binayaran ko na rin (tumawag muna ako to clarify kung para saan ung charges, after we ended the call she mentioned na meron pang natitirang 810 na charges na hndi ko PA raw nabayaran). I was so aggravated the fact that ilang beses kong klinaro ito sa previous na nakausap ko bago pa uli MATRANSFER yung account ko to another agent. Now, they are asking for the said amount and this is the 4th person na naghandle ng account ko which is again nagulat ako kasi HINDI na ako late sa mga payments ko starting last gear up to this day.

Upon coordinating with SB's collection department, we were told to only settle the amount due at that time which is P117,119 and then they will come up with a new payment arrangement for us. We agreed, settled and paid, forwarded deposit slips and such but haven't heard from them since then. So imagine our surprise to find out we were forwarded to an external collections agency, demanding payment and slapped with outrageous collection fees and penalties.  Security Bank were the ones who told us to only pay and they will provide a new payment arrangement.  We didnt get any as of now.  What we are getting are templated responses to our emails saying this is already forwarded to the proper department. This started August.  It is already December. Please help us. Thank you.

And after 2 weeks of waiting the amount credited back to my account is not exactly the amount I'm complaining with .

They dont even explained why they only credited that amount. They can check their cctv cameras if they want to make sure the amount. And i know they can check the amount upon replenishing the cash on their ATM DEPOSIT MACHINE. I WANT MY WHOLE MONEY BACK TO MY ACCOUNT! I incur charges and penalties because of their employee incompetence (which my first complaint and first visit to their branch has not been passed to their resolving officer and my complaint form has been lost).

About a week or two ago, a representative from Fort Rolins Collection Agency visited my mom and telling us that they will repossess the car, which I disputed since I know funds are in the account, the representative asked us to request for a SOA for the auto loan that we did but its taking time, I tried calling the assigned collections agent but even if I try calling the earliest time possible I am not able to get through to seek clarification about this.

Is anything i can do to not pay the accrued interest as there is enough funding on my account to pay the 2 months they did not debit? Thank you.

case_bcETQkXL2T	Hello there. Pwede ba ako magtanong kung may responsibility ba ako na magbigay ng copy ng birth certificate ko sa bangko gayung sila naman ang nagkamali sa pagsulat sa pangalan ko. Na doble kasi nila yung apelyido ko at ginawa din nilang middle name ko which is completely WRONG! Eh in the first place hindi naman ako makakakuha ng valid ID kung mali ang pangalan ko at dahil yung bangko naman ang may kapalpakan I find no obligation to send them a copy of my birth certificate. Could somebody here help me pls? Thanks. BTW yung nirereklamo ko po ay yung digital bank called CIMB.

case_cnsXh1lxkr	Dear Sir/Ma'am,\n\nGood day,\n\nI'm Juan Angelo Mercado and I live in Sasmuan, Pampanga.\nI would like to file a legal complaint against BDO Unibank, Inc. \n\nLast September 07, 2020, I went to BDO Bank Guagua, Pampanga branch to settle my credit card 11-August, 2020 statement balance of P55,469.04 for my VISA CLASSIC due on 07-September, 2020, so I paid the bill amounting of P55,469.04 through cash deposit and over-the-counter payment at BDO bank Guagua,Pampanga branch, Then after that the next day on September 08, 2020 when I had updated my BDO saving account statement balance, there were auto debit charged amounting of P55,469.04 dated September 08, 2020 to my BDO saving account balance resulting to overpayment of P55,469.04. Kindly see the attached file online banking statement indicates as follows;\n\n09/08/2020    BDO CLG ADA PAYMENT   (55,469.04)\n09/07/2020    576 wd                                  (55,469.04)\n\nI have been requesting a refund to return the overpayment of P55,469.04 into my BDO bank saving account for several times through BDO customer contact center 1800-10-631-8000 during the Month of September 2020 up to now but unfortunately the feedback I received from them is the case ID number 03166013 is still in process. So my question is why it has taken over almost 4 months til now not to return my money. It is unacceptable and inexcusable on their part which has taken so long not to return my money because I also need the money badly, It would have been used for other purposes if they had returned it on time.\n\nI hope you could assist me on this matter.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nJuan Angelo Mercado

I immediately reached out to them but no one responded. Then last Aug 10, a 3rd party collection is calling me regarding the loan. Now my loan is in arrears. I paid the moment I have means, which was September.\n\nI feel, I should not be charged with fees and penalties since I've reached out to them since June and no one has bothered getting back to me. \n\nI understand that I still need to pay the loan, however, I feel it's unfair! Is there anyway to remove the penalties?

case_XNEwaAtow7	Complaining Against: Bank Of the Philippine Island (BPI) Good evening po. Ganito po kasi yun.. May inirefund po sakin ang LinkedIn ng $29.99 last week kasi diniduct nila ko sa ATM ko para dun sa subscription na di ko naman alam.. Sabi nila mag rereflect daw yung pera na nirefund nila para sakin sa bank account ko within 5 working days.. Nag reflect naman na sa PayPal account ko na may nirefund na nga sila kaso hanggang ngayon wala pa din sa bank account ko.. Sa BPI... Sabi sakin ng LinkedIn kapag lumampas daw ng 5 working days na hindi pa nag rereflect yung pera sa bank account ko e magsabi na daw ako sa mismong banko (BPI) ilang araw na pong delay wala pa din po hanggang ngayon.. Ilang beses na ko nag try na makipag communicate sa BPI pero hindi talaga sila sumasagot.. Nag chat, and comment na ko sa official FB page nila, nag tweet sa Twitter page nila, nag DM sa Instagram, nag email, at tumawag hotline nila na sobrang tagal na waiting time... Hanggang ngayon wala pa din silang response at wala parin yung pera ko.. Sinubukan ko pong mag mag email sainyo sa BSP consumer affairs customer service pero wala din silang response.. Opo, hindi ganoon kalaki yung perang hinahabol ko pero sa hirap ng buhay ngayon ni isang sentimo po sobrang halaga.. Lalo na ngayon na may pandemic.. 😥😥 Sana mapansin nyo naman po ako.. Alam kong libo libo ang humihingi sainyo ng tulong kaya pray na lang na mapansin nyo ko.. Salamat

case_koQfzYexqF	I encounter harassment from auto collection of Eastwest Bank. My autoloan supposed to end on November 2020, however due to Pandemic, we settled our account for the month of March and won't able to pay the due for the month of April, May, and June. We requested them if they can extend our payables since out last payment will be on November 2020, we request to have move it up to February 2021, extend it by 3 months. They didn't allow it and recommend us to avail their offer of 24 months loan extension, we didn't grab it since it is only few month remaining. However, yesterday I received a call from their collection, told me that our payment for the month of July was adjusted for the month of June, payment of August adjust to July and so on, but they are forcing me to still pay the 7% occured for the late payment from June to October, and settle the remaining monthy  ammortization for the month of October before November 6, since they adjust our settled payment for the month of October to September. If this will not be settle, they will pull out the car from us. I'm requesting your good office to investigate this matter as I think that they're collection officer is not handling it properly to the point that they are forcing to settle it within today considering we only have 5 months remaining to finish the loan. You may contact me thru this no. 09774638243 or email jelo.mescallado11@gmail.com.

case_XWVOTXLflR	China Bank Savings has been ignoring my complaints of harassment by its collection agencies etc when in fact, I paid in PDCs all the way to December and it was their unilateral decision apparently to not post some of the checks I deposited with them.

case_YnLK9T5DAN	Hi,\n\nI was granted a loan way back 2018(maturity date is January 2020) by Algo Leasing which is related to Equicom Savings Bank. Last 2019, I experienced financial difficulties which resulted of missing a payment but managed to pay it still together with the penalties incurred and even informed the bank of my situation. Then come November 2019, I was surprised because my account was endorsed to the Collections Agency named Lauron Law. I spoke with Ms. Elizabeth (Lauron Law's representative) and asked if it's possible to have a payment arrangement because of my situation, she said yes and sent me a message of our agreed arrangment March of this year. The message contains my outstanding balance (around P33000), term (11mos) and the amount to pay (P3000). I was also advised to not miss any payment as I might incur penalties. I paid March and due to covid, I was not able to pay for 2 months (April and May) but it was covered by the Bayanihan Act 1. To my surprise, last June I received a message/phone call from the collections agency and was informed that Ms Grace pAdernal now handles my account. I asked her if she was aware of my agreement with Ms. Elizabeth, she told me no and just continue with our agreed payment until the soa arrives. Because she will based it on the soa. Last friday of this month (October), i was informed of my OB based on Soa anf it's amounting to P56000 plus. I was so agitated and told her I will not pay it because i already had a dis ussion with ms elizabeth and now they are inisisting me to pay the OB based on Soa. \n\nPlease help.

case_PSMhRsVfnV	I'd like to report the unresponsiveness of the EastWest Bank customer service. I'm the co-maker of my sister(Michelle Macalintal) for the autoloan in EastWest Bank. I noticed that we were not debited in the savings account for 2 months already and was advised by EWB customer service that we're automatically enrolled in the Bayanihan Heal as One Act. This is unfair because we didn't provide any authorization to be included in that moratorium. We've been reaching out to EWB via their customer hotline but we're told that they don't know our PN/loan number. We need the loan number as per requirement of EastWest Bank so we can opt out on the said moratorium. We reached out directly to their autoloan department via email and phone but no one can provide our loan number for unknown reasons. I've also sent a private message in their FB account but has not been getting any response since last week. They set a target on Oct 10 that if they didn't hear from us we will be charged by an accrued interest. How can we meet the deadline if they're unresponsive and the customer service is incompetent to provide just the PN/loan number? Hope you can assist us on this urgent matter.

With the pandemic, fares were refunded by AirAsia and was supposedly credited to me on July 11, 2020.

So I would just like to lodge a complaint to fast-track this long-awaited refund that should have been a breeze and credited to me right away in the first place.

case_QmD4eaiucS	I have loaded today 3000 pesos into my paymaya account via 711. Unfortunately payamaya did not reflect the 3000 pesos I loaded into my account. I called paymaya and they said they did not record any transaction of me addid money worth 3000 pesos into my account. I asked 711 to return my money so I can load it somewhere else but 711 said I will have to wait for them to confirm if paymaya did not receive the 3000. I would like to complain these 2 companies for their incompetence. It is not my problem if they are having problems with regards to their systems or whatever. I needed that money to pay for something now I have to withdraw additional funds for that purpose and they want me to wait for them to return the money. Hope you can help with the matter. Im also emailing DTI regarding this since I believe 711 is not under BSP? Attached is the receipt of my transaction with 711 me adding money while the other is a screanshot of my transaction history with paymaya. Thank you.

I called the bank asking for consideration to reverse the charges and that I cant pay the said due amount since im waiting for cebu pacs refund. And it is not fair that i will pay for the interest for the money that i havent used. Metrobank only reasons out that they cant reverse the charges since we are no longer in ecq. Please bangko sentral, im begging for your help on this. It causes me emotional stress both for cebu pac and metrobank card. Their collecting agent is calling me everyday. My point is that, it is not may fault if cebu pac refund takes a longer time to process. It is not fair that they are charging me an interest for the money na hindi ko napakinabangan.

case_GfpIHDn2BY	May issue po ako against BPI Family Savings Bank, auto loan to be specific. I have a 5 year term loan which should end this September 2020. However,  due to the pandemic.  Ndi po ako nkpgbayad ng loan since April 2020. At the same time,  ngkaroon po ng sakit lupus ang wife ko na nahospitalized for a long time so my cash was not enought to pay the loan.  I tried to call the bank to have a payment arrangements pro walang sumasagot siguro due to the pandemic as well.  I was confident na there will be no issue because we have a Bayanihan Act heal as one to provide customers assistance.  However,  i was able to speak to an agent of BPI family savings bank loan and was advised that my loan account was endorsed to a law office. My concern is,  the loan is about to get paid. For 4 plus years,  i no have issues with the payment but now they have immediately transferred the loan a law office without even trying to contact me.  If i didnt call,  i would not know.  As far as i know,  if there was no payment made, the collections team will try to negotiate first before handing over to any law office.

case_PWRysTAMng	My complain was not address by your email. My metrobank creditcard was erroneously charged by Cebupacific last January 16, 2020. I called you to file a dispute but then you advised me to complain in cebu pacific. I called cebu pacific and they told they will  make the reversal but until no reversal was done. I called you several times to seek help because you continues to charge me with penalties because i didnt pay the erroneous charges. Until an agent of yours and me agreed that if the next billing for August cebu pacific did not make a reversal, He will allow me to make a dispute. Come August when my SOA came no reversal was done. So I called you for the last time to make the dispute but the agent made no help. So my last resort is to ask help from BSP. Please do make action on this matter. Cebu Pacific is hanging me for almost 7 months. I inform you ASAP for the error but your agent did nothing. If you will not do anything with this. I will surely bring this up again with BSP.
