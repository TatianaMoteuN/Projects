              "'In the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major Hong Kong media .With their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused Hong Kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .The world \\'s fifth Disney park will soon open to the public here .The most important thing about Disney is that it is a global brand .Well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed Hong Kong with new respect .Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland .The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .One .Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong .As its neighbor on Lantau Island , Hong Kong International Airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .Mickey Mouse \\'s new home , settling on Chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .There \\'s only one month left before the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12 .The subway to Disney has already been constructed .At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens .Meanwhile , the Disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .For two years , Disney has constantly maintained its mystery .No media have been allowed to enter for photos .We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward Disney , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by .However , before any of the Disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards Disney .On our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .Er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially , opened , , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .No one can enter otherwise .Video recording is especially forbidden .Ah , everything is top secret .If pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .Although Disney Corporation chose Hong Kong as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit Hong Kong .From the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists , have come to Hong Kong .Well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .At this point , it has been about two years .Also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .Hong Kong was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today \\'s international metropolis .Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .When in Hong Kong , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in Mong Kok .You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay , where all deities gather .You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in Hong Kong .You can ascend Victoria Peak to get a panoramic view of Victoria Harbor \\'s beautiful scenery .Or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city \\'s blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .After dark , cruise Victoria Harbor at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .Every corner of Hong Kong is filled with fun .Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the Hong Kong tourism industry bring us ?Over the past 28 years , the Ocean Park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to Hong Kong .Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird \\'s eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of Hong Kong Island and the South China Sea .These items , which were the pride of the Ocean Park , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong for some time .However , since Disney entered Hong Kong , the Ocean Park , sharing the same city as Disney , has felt the pressure of competition .To improve the park \\'s brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .That is , the entire park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .It seems that those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center will also be renovated after several years .Are they going to be different from what they are now ?They will be , in ten years .Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .It looks like we will also bring in whales .Er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government .Groundbreaking is expected to start next year .Yes .The area of Hong Kong is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .The population is dense .Natural resources are relatively scarce .However , the clever Hong Kong people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the Hong Kong tourism industry .Among these is the Avenue of Stars .Entering Hollywood of the East ,here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .He is my .She is my Goddess , ah .Please stay with us on New World Travel .Hong Kong has always worn the crown of Hollywood of the East .Over the past 100 years of film history , Hong Kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .They have shortened the distance between Hong Kong and the world .Hong Kong movies have even become a window for the world to see Hong Kong , which have made the image of metropolitan Hong Kong more prominent internationally .For this reason , in 2004 , on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor , the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed the Avenue of Stars , memorializing Hong Kong \\'s 100 - year film history .Here , tourists can learn about Hong Kong \\'s film history , and can come up close with the stars in their mind .Hong Kong is a busy metropolis .Even at dusk , the city \\'s pulse never stops beating .Across from the Avenue of Stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .%pw As our Victoria Harbor is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?So , one idea was to transform Victoria Harbor into a performance stage .Er , each key building is like a performer .It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza , Bank of China Tower , at 8:00 every Saturday night , HSBC Main Building .Their performances will be on schedule .Center of the East Central .Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island reveal themselves one by one , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .Some , er , cities have consulted with us .Uh-huh .Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .Yes .The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building \\'s reward .Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of Hong Kong hopes to be involved , so that the Hong Kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .Hong Kong Wetland Park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the Hong Kong SAR government for advancing the Hong Kong tourism industry .This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the Hong Kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .Hong Kong Wetland Park covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor \\'s center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .In the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .Outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology ., er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,but behind me is our Wetland Park .Ha , entirely different .Quite primitive ,er , a fresh water swamp ,er , the Wetland Park Exploration Center .Lastly , farthest away you can see Putian of Shenzhen .Then , , on the bridge is Hong Kong and outside is Shenzhen .You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .Ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many Hong Kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .Look over there .They are going to be ripe soon .The long one over there .Oh .Yes ., with ears , ah .Where ?Ah , here .Perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them ., let them get some understanding .Mai Po Marshes adjacent to Wetland Park is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong \\'s skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Wetland Park .These have become the best spots to observe birds .Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .It is an endangered bird species throughout the world .Uh-huh .Ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .Wow .Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to Hong Kong to spend the winter .Some of them , er , have stayed in Hong Kong Wetland Park .Uh-huh .So , our park \\'s logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people \\'s attention .Uh-huh .Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .They will complete the park \\'s entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign .Ah , we have established the year 2006 as Discover Hong Kong Year .Why is that ?Because , as everyone knows , our Disneyland will open in September of this year .In addition , we will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the Giant Buddha .They add to what we already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .Moreover , er , we are including our software .Hong Kong \\'s software is very well known .Like what \\'s used in our Symphony of Lights .We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year .Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .Because your line connects us with two --In recent years , Hong Kong \\'s tourist attractions have gradually moved from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and the New Territory .Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on Lantau Island of the New Territory .For this reason , Lantau Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot .The earliest to settle here was this world \\'s largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .Therefore , Hong Kong \\'s Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of China , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in the east , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of China .As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .Since this giant bronze Buddha settled on Lantau Island , the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .The important status of Lantau Island is increasingly apparent .No , it was totally inaccessible in the past .In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting Hong Kong , Zhuhai , and Macao .In 1992 --Could n\\'t go in summer --So , after their return , Macao , and Hong Kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .It \\'s extremely troublesome to get there via land .One has to go up to Shenzhen , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to Zhuhai , then pass through Zhuhai to get to Macao .For a Hong Kong person choosing to go there via land , it \\'s extremely inconvenient .A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .With this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .This is what we have seen since 1999 .Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .Well , originally the construction of the new --With this new Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , Hong Kong , Macao , and Zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .Macao is this way , and Zhuhai is this way .From the perspective of either Hong Kong , Macao , or Zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .Er , %pw Zhuhai for sightseeing tours , Macao for entertainment , and we have Disneyland and , other attractions in Hong Kong .Each place has different attractions of its own .So , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .Once the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later .Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .However , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .Ah , currently it has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 .There \\'s also what we call soft opening .Ah , they are now rehearsing .Ah , , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in September .Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to Disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied .The Wonder Tour will start from Hong Kong .This dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .It continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .Each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .Hong Kong is a world famous shopping paradise .What determined the position of Hong Kong as a shopping paradise ?Is it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low prices ?Is it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?After all , what are the joyful memories from inside paradise ?We respectfully invite you to watch Hong Kong : a Shopping Paradise in this edition of Across China .Hello , everyone .This is the Cross Strait program on CCTV International Channel .Welcome to our program .First let \\'s focus on the main contents of today \\'s program .Wang Jin - pyng says that he has decided not to continue serving as KMT vice chairman .Candidates for the giant pandas to be presented to Taiwan as gifts from the mainland may increase .Taiwan \\'s military uses Taipei Aerospace Exhibition as an opportunity for

frozen in California \\'s Sierra Nevada mountains with just a few tantalizing clues to his identity /?This we do know at this hour /.The man died more than sixty years ago /.He was in the military apparently a World War Two airman /.And while it looks like his plane crashed in the mountains so did twenty - five other planes around the same time /.Thelma Gutierrez went inside the forensic laboratory where scientists are trying to solve this mystery /.An address book a plastic comb a vintage penny /.You \\'re looking at the last things a young airman put into his pockets on the day he

climbers discovered a frozen man face down in the snow still in his army air force uniform and an unopened silk parachute /.After six decades the airman is exhumed from his icy tomb and thawed out /.but he \\'s wearing no military dog tags or ID /.Did this World War Two pilot perish when his training flight crashed in the mountains like twenty - five other ill fated flights more than sixty years ago /?The search for clues takes us to Honolulu Hawaii to the joint powmia accounting command or jpac /.The mystery of the frozen airman is just one of more than a thousand different unsolved cases that scientists here at jpac are trying to solve /.In this laboratory alone I \\'m surrounded by the remains of at least twenty different service members who are in the process of being identified so that they too can go home /.The investigation begins with a team of forensic specialists who probe and study the airman \\'s bones teeth and his belongings to piece together who he is /.And almost immediately clues begin to surface /.Dr. Robert Mann a forensic anthropologist has determined that the airman was Caucasian and had fair hair /.Next though I \\'m going to have to look at his clavicles /.The airman \\'s collar bones and pelvic bones prove that he was in his twenties and died in an airplane crash /.This is a person who likely died on impact versus perhaps freezing to death up in the mountains /.I think that uh the injuries were so substantial um and severe that he would n\\'t have felt anything /.He would have died immediately /.One two /-Another important clue /.He has a significant number of uh fillings /.Like the bones xrays of his wisdom teeth also tell us something about his age /.Root tips are closed /.they \\'re sealed up which is more indicative of

examination of each address book they yield no personal information clues that could have faded with time /.And so while we still do not know who our twenty - something fair - haired airman is enormous progress has been made /.Out of the thousands of unidentified World War Two service members Dr. Mann says they \\'ve narrowed it down to just ten /.So what was it like to grow up there /?In Pleasant Grove we recently met these three sisters all in their eighties who have high hopes that the frozen airman proves to be their big brother Glen Munn whose plane went missing in the Sierra back in nineteen forty - two /.Oh I just wanted you know to know that he was found and that we can have him brought home here for burial and /-We do n\\'t know that though /.We do n\\'t /.but that \\'s my wishes /.And until they learn otherwise they say they will keep that hope alive /.And in the weeks and months ahead scientists are convinced they will identify this airman and return him home to his family wherever they might be /.Thelma Gutierrez CNN Honolulu Hawaii /.And there are some new developments to talk about tonight /.Scientists may be even closer to solving the mystery /.For an update we \\'re joined by Dr. Robert Mann one of the senior scientists you just saw working on this cold case /.Thanks for spending time with us tonight doctor /.We understand since Thelma left your laboratories you \\'ve now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.is that true /?Well hi Paula /.yes we have /.Uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago our analysts and historians got to work on that /.and they were able to wittle it down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.and at this point they \\'ve wittled it down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.So we \\'ve gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.So how much easier will that make it for you to unlock this case , do you think /?Well I think it \\'ll help quite a bit /.Um any time you \\'ve got a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they \\'re in pretty good condition such as this one is , it \\'s mummified remains /.We have some soft tissue we can deal with /.so we can look at the color of the hair /.we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.and that \\'s where we \\'re going to now /.So in the interest of full disclosure what I know about forensics is basically what I \\'ve learned on CSI /.and one would think that because you \\'ve got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential DNA match with what you \\'ve found in the ice /.Is it not that simple /?Well no no it \\'s not that simple /.Um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what we \\'re looking at /.And what we want to do is we do n\\'t want to just look at the material evidence that we have and immediately um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.What we want to do is have the evidence speak for itself /.and when we look at this individual as we \\'ve done the biological profile looking at his remains his bones his teeth and the material evidence /.and what we \\'re able to tell from this individual is that he died in his twenties he stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um he sustained massive trauma to his body on impact /.And he \\'s Caucasoid male /.and so we know much more now just one week later than what we did when he came in about eight days ago /.So the most important question is when do you think you \\'re going to know exactly who he is /?Well that \\'s the most commonly asked question that we have /.and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.Nobody knows for sure exactly when we \\'ll identify him /.What it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for successful identification /.If I were to give my best opinion in this it would be a few weeks to a few months /.Well we \\'ll be keeping our fingers crossed for you /.Know how hard you all are working in the lab there Dr. Mann /.Thank you for spending some time

/.Pandemic flu does n\\'t exist yet /.But a lot of people are talking about it /.and I think that \\'s remarkable to a lot of people eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that we \\'re a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients /.The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n\\'t have the surge capacity and that \\'s going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula /.Uh let \\'s talk about the other problem of the plan where the president wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like Tamaflu and Rolenza /.Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n\\'t even presented itself /?here \\'s the important thing about that /.We do n\\'t know for sure /.A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on Tamaflu and Rolenza /.These are antiviral drugs /.they are not vaccines /.They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact /.But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.So it \\'s just theoretical really for the most part that those will work Paula /.Dr. Sanjay Gupto thanks for the update /.By the way are you catching a cold /?A a little bit /.You know I just got back /.and the ninteen hour plane ride /.Not bird flu though /.I can assure you that Paula /.Chicken soup /.That \\'s right

suspect Joran Van Der Sloot is interrogated for the fourth straight day by a team of behavioral specialists NBC \\'s Michelle Kosinski remains in Aruba /.So Michelle the authorities really believe that uh this witness with regard to the landfill \\'s credible , do n\\'t they /?Well the authorities including the FBI we found out had checked this witness out early on just days after Natalee disappeared /.And we just found out about this witness a couple weeks ago /.That \\'s when his existence became widely known through private investigators and other sources /.And it has been reported that he was afraid to come forward /.Well it turns out he was just afraid for his identity to be known /.but we learned that he came forward very quickly after he says he saw what happened in the landfill that day just days after it happened /.He talked to police /.He talked to the FBI /.The FBI actually went out to that landfill with dogs looked around that area even before it became piled up with garbage /.and they did n\\'t find anything /.It \\'s the EquuSearch volunteers who really said hey we believe this guy /.His story does n\\'t change /.He seems to pan out /.He seems to be a lucid guy /.He seems to also be insistent that he saw something /.So he says he saw some men drive up in a white pickup truck men that he says he later recognized to be the three suspects in this case /.He says they took what looked like a body out of the back of the pickup truck /.It was wrapped up in a bag /.But when the wind blew he says he saw the upper part of a woman \\'s body blonde hair /.and then he says they buried this body there in the landfill /.Well over a period of weeks some ten feet of garbage has piled up /.EquuSearch will tell you too that when they bring out dogs it \\'s very difficult for a dog to catch a scent in that landfill when they \\'re coming across things like medical waste /.but they \\'re determined to keep going /.He saw uh the woman \\'s body and inside a bag /.Her hair was blowing out with the wind /.And uh he did n\\'t say this now /.but he told that the back kind of came off and he saw half of the woman \\'s body /.One of the most compelling reasons searchers say they believe this guy very much is that they say he gave them some clues as to things they would find buried deep within that garbage around that same area where he claims he saw a body things like a plastic pool /.He said that there was a dirt road buried under all that garbage /.Well they found those things and a couple of other items that he said would be there /.The problem is they just have n\\'t found any sign at all of Natalee Holloway /.but they want to clear that place out and just feel satisfied that they looked as best they could because it \\'s disturbing /.I mean his story has panned out in some ways /.so they do n\\'t want to give this up /.Well that \\'s the question I have for you Michelle /.So are you saying that the authorities uh looked into this guy \\'s story early on and they kind of pooh - poohed it and then EquuSearch came in a couple weeks later and said wait a sec , wait a sec , let \\'s give this guy a shot here and they followed up on it /?Yeah pretty much /.Uh the witness told us directly that in the beginning he felt like nobody was believing his story /.But we talked to a high level source in law enforcement /.and it turns out they did check it out /.Hm /.They sent the FBI out there with a dog /.But EquuSearch says hey maybe we can do something more thoroughly here /.We can bring out teams of dogs /.But here \\'s the thing

everyone was greeting all the guys with this grip handshake /.All the girls approach him with a kiss on the cheek /.It was interesting how um you know he was able to order these group of girls by just merely leaning over the bar and ordering three shots of one fifty - one one for himself and three for the tourists with no money /.So he \\'s got an open uh tab at Carlos N\\' Charlie \\'s /.able to run a tab /.And you know then you notice that in a evening \\'s proceeding he \\'s even approaching these girls getting close to closing time /.Did /.So that \\'s another unique pattern that he has /.did she say uh anything about uh violence /?No she did n\\'t say anything about violence /.but what I was looking for was a history is a predatory type behavior which I think Joran and Deepak and Satish have and how tightly connected the three are /.Now i- /.Joining me now is the private investigator who has been uh working with Natalee \\'s family TJ Ward and his associate Harold Phipps /.Gentlemen thanks very much uh for coming on the program /.+Appreciate it /.Thank you /.TJ let me start with you on this issue of this woman uh who came up uh to Beth /.Have you been able to follow up on that /.and how relevant do you think it is /?Uh we have n\\'t followed up with it /.Um Beth and I have talked about it /.and we will be following up on it uh here shortly /.is it relevant /?I mean a lot of my viewers wrote in saying alright so what /.this guy \\'s a pickup artist /.how does that really impact the case /?Well it just shows it \\'s a pattern of um what his activity is when he hangs out at Carlos N\\' Charlie \\'s /.I mean and trying to pick women up and take them from the bar and whatever he \\'s doing with them after that /.But if there \\'s no violence associated with that does that help you in the investigation /?Well again we do n\\'t think there was a violent issue with him with Natalee /.We think probably +something has happened to Natalee /.and they panicked and then went forth and did what they were supposed to do /.I mean there \\'s issues that \\'s come up /.Um um well we feel something happened when Natalee was with them /.What do you mean by that /?Either she either passed out regurgitated /.um something had happened /.And on top of that now there \\'s a statement that \\'s come up from Joran Van Der Sloot that he \\'s given to the police uh one of twenty - two statements he \\'s given by the way that um Deepak had uh raped her and killed her on the beach /.So at this point what the police have you know again we \\'re unaware because we \\'re not getting any information from law enforcement /.so we have to go on the course of information that we \\'re gathering on behalf of the family /.Well let me ask Harold how do you all know that /?I mean that information for example about that particular statement that TJ was just mentioning /.How do we know that /?Yeah how do you know that that statement was actually made by Joran Van Der Sloot /?Oh we do n\\'t /.This is the statements that were being attributed to us on those /.Uh since we have n\\'t interviewed Joran we do n\\'t know exactly what he has said /.but some of that statement has been let out /.and uh through a chain of different individuals uh uh they have told us uh what the statement was /.TJ just so I \\'m clear where are you getting that from that that statement was made by Joran about Deepak /?I have seen a copy of the statement from one of the local newspapers here um Diario /.Um Jossy Mansur produced and showed me a copy of that statement that uh Joran Van Der Sloot made um the last time that I was here in Aruba /.and uh he conveyed it from Dutch into English and uh showed me the statement /.Uh TJ are you in any trouble there /?I mean there \\'s been a lot of discussions about the authorities getting uh annoyed about you knocking on doors and things like that /.Well it \\'s not that /.Um there was some /.the Aruban authorities /-and we \\'ve had conversations about this /.This is squared away /.It \\'s been straightened out /.Um there was uh some evidence that leaked out to the fact that had an arrest warrant for my arrest on Wednesday and that I was working without a work permit and I was going to be deported by law enforcement and Wednesday night the law enforcement was looking for me to arrest me /.Uh all that is untrue /.and I want to make that perfectly clear /.Uh this was brought up by another media station here on the island that uh made claim to that /.but I can to assure /.Alright /.It \\'s not true /.We \\'ll move on /.Alright /.Yes /.Alright /.Um uh Harold finally this landfill /.Uh are you hopeful uh that EquuSearch is going to find something /?How credible do you think that witness is who says that he saw three men dumping what looked like a blonde body /?Well uh as a retired FBI agent I \\'m always hopeful for an outcome /.Uh we interviewed the individual at length /.and having experienced hundreds if not thousands of interviews during my thirty - one years uh this guy was very uh online /.He did n\\'t go mm ah /.I mean he was like telling a story /.and it did n\\'t appear to me at all like he was coached or practiced /.Mhm /.He just told a story uh from the beginning to the end /.and I believe him /.I think there was something there /.if there is the body , whether it \\'s still there is another story /.Mhm /.There has been uh a period of time since then /.and it could have been removed again /.But uh his story I think is credible /.We also had a /-TJ /.Sorry go ahead /.finish up Harold /.No go ahead /.I was just going to a- /-I \\'m out of time /.I was going to ask TJ bottom line do you think that you \\'re going to be able to crack the case in the next uh couple weeks /?Well it depends /.I believe that law enforcement uh since the FBI \\'s been here has been working very credibly /.Mhm /.And uh I believe that they have something um that \\'s probably solid enough and hopeful uh come September fourth that Joran Van Sloot will stay where he \\'s positioned right now /.Mhm /.and that there \\'ll be additional arrests in this matter from uh parties and individuals that waited we already know that are possibly involved in this disappearance /.Alright /.TJ Ward and Harold Phipps thanks a lot guys for taking the time /.Really appreciate it /.Coming up two former jurors in the Michael Jackson case writing tell - all books about the case /.They now apparently say Jackson is guilty /.and they \\'re apparently saying that they broke all kinds of rules in the jury room sneaking in tapes of news reports /.An insider on the new books joins me next /.And it \\'s been a month since this man went missing on a honeymoon on a Mediterranean cruise /.Police now looking into three men who might \\'ve had something to do with his disappearance /.maybe foul play /.And our weeklong series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose wraps up tonight /.We \\'re trying to get these guys before they strike again /.We \\'ll check in with Erin Runnion five year old daughter Samantha raped and killed by a sex offender /.Your email abrams report at MSNBC dot com /.Please include your name where you \\'re writing from /.I respond at the end of the show /.New York Daily News today reports that jurors are saying there were all sorts of shannanigans going on in the jury room at the Michael Jackson case , that a juror wanted to convict Jackson smuggled in a medical dictionary to prove Jackson fits the definition of a pedophile /.She was later she says intimidated into changing her vote to not guilty /.Same juror we told you about yesterday Eleanor Cook who \\'s reportedly writing a tell - all book titled Guilty as Sin Free as a Bird /.News also reports another allegation that quote another juror sneaked a forbidden video of Court TV broadcast featuring the prosecution friendly Dianne Dimond and Nancy Grace to the jury room but a faulty VCR prevented a sneak peak /.And then a quote gang of three female jurors were such rabid Jackson fans that they cooed not my Michael when the panel discussed the felony charges against the pop idol /.Yikes /.Stacy Brown MSNBC analyst author of Michael Jackson the Man Behind the Mask and a name who keeps popping up with all these books /.Stacy are you writing any of these books first of all /?No I \\'m not /.Alright /.But you actually talked to these jurors about writing a book /.That \\'s correct /.Alright /.and you were approached alright /.I was approached /.And so they are saying the things that the Daily News reports , are they not /?Well they are saying a lot more than just that /.What else they saying /?Um well eh let \\'s just clear up with the medical book /.She did n\\'t actually bring it into the deliberation room /.the jurors were meeting /.They rendezvoused at a juvenile hall in Santa Maria /.and she bought it there /.and as they were getting into the van they ordered it to put it back in her car /.but she wanted them to understand Ellie Cook this is that this fits Michael to a tee /.So she wanted them to know Michael Jackson \\'s guilty , he \\'s a pedophile /.and then what /?Then she just caved /?She says she was pressured /.Think she was threated /.and they were threatening to throw her off the jury /.Come on /.this is the one who \\'s been wanting to write a book since the beginning , right /?Yeah absolutely /.Her granddaughter had put out feelers since she was picked for the jury /.What other kind of shannigans were going on back there , do they say /?Well um they mentioned um as you had mentioned in your open about the Court TV video /.Someone had apparently taped some Court TV um stuff /.and they tried to play it /.Uh apparently it was a malfunction in the video tape /.Mhm /.Well let me give the juror \\'s explanation for this /.And /.This is Paula Coccoz /.we talked to her today juror number ten /.It \\'s number four /.Uh the bailiff brought in a TV with a VCR so we could review the sheriff \\'s interview /.and we went to put in the tape /.The tape was marked Court TV /.The people at the courthouse had left this tape in the VCR /.We told the bailiff about this /.and he seemed concerned about whether or not we reviewed the tape /.We told them we did n\\'t watch it /.We did n\\'t find out until later what was on the tape /.Yeah /.according to Ellie though someone taped that show /.It was n\\'t left there /.Um and there was a problem /.Now I know that someone else mentioned that there was a problem as well with a VCR /.but if you remember well the interview with the sheriff and the young boy was on a disk and not a VCR /.And this is number five /.Uh this is again the Daily News /.That Cook uh admits that she frequently winked at Jackson \\'s mother um Katherine in court and exchanged wardrobe tips with the entertainer \\'s mom which resulted in them wearing the same colors on certain days /.Ellie Cook talked about that yeah /.She mentioned that they would wink and nod at each other /.I do n\\'t understand /.So on the one hand this juror \\'s saying I was convinced he was guilty you know /.and they \\'re saying oh she was trying to bring in a medical text /.and on the other hand she \\'s sitting there winking at Katherine Jackson talking to her about what clothes they \\'re going to wear /.Saying everything was going to be okay /.She /-And that \\'s why you did n\\'t believe this story /.That \\'s why I do n\\'t yeah ah /.That \\'s why you would n\\'t write the book /.I \\'m not writing it because I just think that there \\'s a lot of issues with this /.if you felt that this guy was guilty , you felt he was a pedophile , he lives in your community , he \\'s a very powerful member of your community why let him free then /?Do you just not believe these jurors /?Is that the problem /?I just do n\\'t believe them /.Why /?I mean they \\'re making this up for money /?It \\'s just /-well uh you know I think in both their cases they feel now in retrospect maybe we made a mistake /.And see I can live with that if that \\'s what they are saying /.but they \\'re not saying that /.They \\'re saying that they believed all along he was guilty /.and I \\'m having a hard time with that /.Alright Stacy uh stick around for a minute /.Joining me now NBC News legal analyst former prosecutor Susan Filan and attorney and Celebrity Justice executive producer Harvey Levin criminal defense attorney Daniel Horowitz /.Harv what do you make of /-Look you \\'ve followed this close /.What do you make of all this /?Well I think Eleanor Cook is a wacko Dan /.and I think if any of these allegations are true these jurors need to be prosecuted /.I mean this is jury tampering from within the jury if these allegations are true /.And if there is ever to be a fair celebrity trial again especially in California somebody needs to say look we are drawing the line /.You \\'re not going to get books at the end of the rainbow and do things inappropriate /.If it pans out it \\'s true I think Tom Sneddon himself should prosecute without respect to whether it would have been pro or anti Michael Jackson /.So Susan let \\'s assume for a minute it \\'s true /.Again you \\'re the prosecutor /.and you \\'re sitting there going are you kidding me /?There were two or three jurors who wanted to convict /.and they caved because they were pressured or whatever /.You ca n\\'t do anything , can you /?Nothing /.eh game over /.You ca n\\'t take an appeal from an aquittal /.The problem that I have with this is as members of the media we had an awfully difficult time with access to this trial /.If this is going to set a precedent to shut media out because these highly publicized celebrity trials yield these faulty verdicts she \\'s doing far far more harm than she could ever understand /.Yeah but let \\'s forget about the media stuff /.I mean the bottom line is the prosecutors ca n\\'t do anything about this , right /?I mean if the jurors were tampering with evidence , if they were playing with evidence et cetera back there the prosecutors have to just suck it up and be depressed /.There \\'s no remedy /.They have to eat it /.It \\'s over /.Daniel I mean Stacy does n\\'t really believe them /.but what do you think /?Well Dan I believe them /.You know jurors are people /.We expect them to be perfect little robots doing what the judge says /.and they do n\\'t /.They \\'re going to watch television /.I \\'m sure they all watch your show /.and they watched Susan try to convict Michael Jackson /.but then I hope they listened to me and to reason /.But the bottom line is they reached a fair and just verdict /.You have to trust people and nail those attempts to control and hypercontrol this case /.Just backfired /.It made the jurors feel isolated /.and now they \\'re all quiet /.They wo n\\'t talk to us about what really went on /.Okay here \\'s my problem /.It \\'s this woman saying she was forced and bullied right into reaching the verdict that she did /.and there she is saying I did n\\'t like the way that this woman snapped at me talking about the accuser \\'s mother et cetera /. /.You know Dan I do n\\'t even talk to juries afterwards unless I win because you \\'re always going to hear things like that /.People in a jury room are in a bar room brawl /.It \\'s not supposed to be pretty /.and when it \\'s over there \\'s always second thoughts and regrets /.but it \\'s the system /.and it works /.Harvey you know what /.eh hey hey if I may say /-But Dan your point is that /-You know a bar room brawl is one thing /.They were acting like outlaws if these allegations are true /.Right /.And you know I agree Susan that the prosecutors ca n\\'t do anything to Michael Jackson /.but they certainly can do something to the jurors /.and I think it is more important right now to say /-I \\'m telling you Dan you and I have covered a lot of trials in this city /.and we \\'ve seen a lot of weird things happen since OJ Simpson with books and everything else /.If jurors realize that there \\'s a back end if you will which is a Hollywood term to these trials and if they get caught so what they get caught but they can still publish a book if they believe that everything is going to change in this city /.let me ask you /.Harv here \\'s the thing that I do n\\'t understand /.And this is why Stacy made the right call on this /.Alright Stacy may say he did n\\'t believe them whatever /.I do n\\'t think that many people are going to buy this book /.Is that Stacy /?I did n\\'t either /.Is that the real reason you did n\\'t want to write the book Stacy /?Well no no that \\'s not the b- /-You did n\\'t think you were going to make any money /?Come on /.That \\'s the real reason , is n\\'t it /?No /.the real reason is Dan believe it or not I have a conscience /.I wrote Man Behind the Mask with Bob Jones because I believed in Bob Jones /.and I still believe in the material /.I do n\\'t believe in this material /.uh Harvey do you agree with me that the book \\'s not really going to sell much /?Absolutely /.For two reasons /.Number one I think it would have been a better book if he would have been found guilty /.And secondly I think the credibility of the authors um mean a whole lot /.and eh you know I just think everything is so off - kilter people are n\\'t going to be particularly interested in it /.Yes /.Yeah /.Uh reminder /.you can hear from uh those two jurors who now say Jackson \\'s guilty premiere of Rita Cosby Live and Direct Monday night at nine PM eastern right here on MSNBC /. /.Susan Filan \\'s going to stick around /.Harv Daniel Horowitz thanks a lot /.appreciate it /.Coming up no clear explanation for what happened to a honeymooner who disappeared from a Mediterranean cruise last month /.Police now focusing on three men seem to be telling some inconsistent stories /.And our series on wanted sex offenders around

with Erin Runnion whose five year old girl was raped and murdered by a convicted sex offender /.Coming up , man disappears on his honeymoon cruise ship /.Police on the case focusing now on three men seem to be telling some inconsistent stories /.More on the investigation coming up /.but first the headlines /.Hello I \\'m Milissa Rehberger /.Here \\'s what \\'s happening /.The Russian military is racing to rescue seven sailors trapped in a minisubmarine six hundred and twenty - five feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean /.The sub got snagged in a giant fishing net /.A US Airforce jet carrying robotic undersea vehicles is on its way from California to aid in that rescue /.It \\'s expected to arrive in ten to twelve hours /.It is unclear how much oxygen remains onboard that minisub /.The Russian Navy \\'s chief spokesperson says there may only be about twelve hours worth while another official says there \\'s more than twenty - four hours left /.British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the crackdown on terrorists and extremists in the wake of the London bombing /.He proposed new deportation measures against people who advocate violence /.And a new anti-insurgents operation underway in western Iraq /.US marines and Iraqi troops launched Operation Quick Strike in the Euphrates River Valley /.That is northwest of Baghdad /.That \\'s where twenty - two marines were killed this week /.Back to the Abrams Report /.Exactly a month after twenty - six year old George Smith vanished from a Royal Caribbean ship cruising in the Mediterranean NBC News has learned federal investigators are now focusing on three men who were traveling on the cruise ship called Brilliance of the Seas two Russian brothers who live in Brooklyn and one man who lives in California /.The attorney for the California man issued this statement /.We \\'ve been cooperating with the FBI and the US Attorney \\'s Office in their investigation /.and we \\'ll continue to do so /.However we \\'ve been asked by the authorities not to speak with the media while the investigation is pending /.and we intend to honor that request /.This photo taken the day shows what appears to be blood on the awning below the cabin where Smith and his wife were staying /.Smith was traveling on his honeymoon and had left Barcelona Spain on June twenty - ninth /.what was meant to be a twelve day cruise /.Halfway through the trip on the morning of July fifth he disappeared /.He was reported missing later that day when the ship docked in Kusadasi Turkey /.NBC has also learned that Smith \\'s new wife Jennifer Hagel has been questioned is not a suspect /.Two were married on June twenty - fifth in Newport Rhode Island /.Joining me now former Connecticut prosecutor NBC News uh legal analyst Susan Filan who \\'s been covering the case closely and Orlando police chief Walter uh Zalisko who was on the same cruise that Smith travelled on as well as forensic expert Larry Kobilinsky /.Alright so Susan what do you know about the investigation /?Well NBC news has learned from a law enforcement source that the wife is not a suspect and that they are focusing in on these two Russian brothers as you said who live in Brooklyn /.The California teen is apparently the key to the case at this point /.That \\'s law enforcement \\'s focus /.If this young man will talk this could break open what happened to George /.The key question is is this a tragic accident or is this foul play /?Right now law enforcement seems to think it \\'s foul play /.US attorney Kevin O\\'Connor said we have reason to believe there could have been foul play here /.Um alright uh Mister Zalisko do you know anything from your personal experience of having been on the cruise as to what happened /?Uh good evening sir /.Uh first I \\'d just like to clarify I \\'m a police chief in Oak Hill Florida not Orlando /.Uh now as far as the cruise uh I was on the cruise that uh uh day /.and the way I became aware of what occured was that uh the morning of the fifth a relative of mine had mentioned that there was blood stain on the canopy beneath her uh balcony /.at that point we kind of dismissed it /.We did n\\'t know what was uh going on /.Uh we then went on our daily excursion /.However later on into the cruise that day uh the ship \\'s captain went onto the PA system and made an announcement that uh authorities were on the ship and they were investigating the possibility that an individual had gone overboard during the night or early morning hours /.When I asked my cousin the uh size of the blood splatter she had indicated it was relatively the size of a small uh dog of a beagle type /.However viewing those photographs on TV that blood splatter is much larger than uh a small dog /.Mhm /.In fact it \\'s maybe three to four feet in length /.And then we \\'ve been hearing many stories that uh there were a lot of people going into and out of the state rooms uh which would indicate that the crime scene was not properly secured in the early stages of the investigation /.Well /.Alright let me play this piece of sound from one of the passengers who was uh staying right nearby uh this particular uh room /.We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin /.Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing /.And he says uh later um chief that he heard a horrific thud /.Well yeah that would indicate that something did go on there /.and we know uh that the three individuals were in a room uh with Mister Smith /.And the question that has to be uh presented to everybody is why is it taking so long for authorities to interview the individual that was in a cabin next door /?Mhm /.Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after the crime /.Yeah /.Yeah /.And you would not just interview that individual next door /.You would have to take a step to interview people above below and to both sides /.Susan what \\'s the answer to that /?But Dan /.there are jurisdictional problems here /.You know it \\'s not a clear cut case as to who gets to prosecute this case /.Turkey ca n\\'t do anything without a body /.United States can /.Fair play of the United States for stepping in /.fair play to law enforcement for getting involved /.Jurisdiction is n\\'t clear /.but they \\'re working very hard to solve the crime /.I do n\\'t think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in this case /.Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got their investigators and their lawyers in from what I understand right away to make this go away /.so I think law enforcement was put in a bad position trying to play catchup /.and I think they \\'re doing +an amazing job /.Larry so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence /?Well it \\'s very difficult Dan /.Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body /.therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death /.But we do have some physical evidence /.Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me it was not done the proper way /.It was n\\'t a forensic photograph /.So I really do not know how large the stain was in its dimensions /.but it is pretty clear that there \\'s a lot of blood there great deal of blood /.It makes you think that something criminal occured /.But again getting back to how you solve the crime you got to go to the crime scene /.and I think there are multiple scenes here /.Every place there \\'s blood it \\'s a crime scene /.But the most important place is the cabin because that \\'s presumably where the injury took place /.Now there was some rumor about some arguments going casino the night before /.Uh and it could very well be that he was arguing with these individuals /.so uh that could be the tie the connection /.and I think good policework would connect the individuals in question with the casino with Mister Smith /.and that might help us understand what happened /.this is um a little bit more sound /.This is again from Cletus Hyman uh who was literally um in a joining or nearby cabin um as to what he heard around he said four in the morning the day before uh Mister Smith went missing /.At times it sounded like furniture was being actually picked up and dropped /.and then that horrific uh thud /.Yeah I mean that sure sounds to me chief like we \\'re not talking about someone who /-I mean I guess it \\'s possible if you \\'re talking about loud yelling coming /-Well look if this guy \\'s right that loud yelling is coming from the cabin right and the wife is not a real suspect here means that there was probably someone else in there /.Well there absolutely was someone else in that room /.And what \\'s interesting is there was a witness who uh had informed ship \\'s authorities that she had heard a scream uh early that morning /.And what \\'s really interesting is uh we do n\\'t know if she \\'s been interviewed at this point /.But it was five days later that the ship \\'s attorneys had begun to question her not law enforcement but ship \\'s attorneys /.We will uh continue to follow this /.Chief Zalisko of the Oakhill Police Department sorry about that Susan Filan Larry Kobilinsky thanks a lot /.Coming up two mothers both their daughters kidnapped raped killed /.Join us for the final installment of our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.And you know I sort of pooh - poohed the idea that two jurors from the Michael Jackson trial are now writing tell - all books saying that they think Michael Jackson \\'s guilty /.You respond to me , coming up /.Abrams Report at MSNBC dot com is where you send your emails /.Please include your name where you \\'re writing from /.I respond at the end of the show /.Coming up , our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose continues with two mothers who lost very loved ones to really these monsters , coming up /.All week we \\'ve been continuing with our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.In a moment I \\'m going to talk with two very courageous mothers who both lost daughters to sex offenders /.But first I want to highlight some of the wanted sex offenders running free before they strike /.This time in New York state /.Tomas Meddaugh is a oh he \\'s not thirty that guy \\'s what fifty alright fifty year old white male five foot seven a hundred and sixty - eight pounds with scars near his left eyebrow and shoulder his neck and abdomen /.He \\'s got a prior conviction for rape /.and his current offense involved deviant sexual intercourse with a thirteen year old girl /.He \\'s considered armed and dangerous /.Francisco Paulino is a forty - six year old Hispanic male five foot nine hundred and forty no scars or tattoos that they know of /.He does have a prior conviction for the knifepoint rape of a fourteen year old girl /.He \\'s violated his parole /.He \\'s wanted /.Dion Bryant twenty - four year old black male standing five foot six one fifty - six /.Convicted for attempted rape /.three underage girls involved /.He too has violated his parole /.Wanted /.Anyone with information about their whereabouts should call New York \\'s a hundred most wanted tipline one eight hundred two six two four three two one and keep in mind that these guys really may be dangerous /.so /-Now the women you \\'re about to meet lost their children to vicious predators /.Samantha Runnion was uh just eleven days away from her sixth birthday when she was kidnapped sexually assaulted and murdered by a man named Alejandro Avila /.He \\'s been sentenced to death for those crimes /.In choosing to destroy Samantha \\'s life you chose this /.You chose to waste your life to satisfy a selfish and sick desire /.You knew it was wrong /.and you chose not to think about it /.Well now you have a lot of time to think about it /.Do n\\'t waste it /.Write it down so that the rest of us can figure out how to stop you people /.You \\'re a disgrace to the human race /.And Dru Sjodin was a twenty - two year old college student /.She was abducted and killed /.Alfonso Rodriguez a man with prior convictions for assaulting women is facing trial accused of kidnapping and murder /.Convicted he too uh could get the death penalty /.Joining me now is Samantha Runnion \\'s mother Erin Runnion and Dru Sjodin \\'s mother Linda Walker /.Thanks so much uh for coming on the program /.We appreciate it /.Alright Erin let me start with you /.What do you think the biggest problem is out there when it comes to these sex offenders /?Well I think that there \\'s a gross misconception about sex offender crimes /.I think most do not realize how pervasive the problem is /.The sex offenders that we have caught are a very small percentage of those that are out there /.Statistically one in four girls and as many as one in six to ten boys are sexually assaulted before they are eighteen /.That \\'s nationwide /.This problem is much bigger than I think people are realizing /.And Linda I guess what we \\'re realizing as we have been highlighting these wanted sex offenders around the country is how many of them are still out there and wanted /.Well currently there \\'s um right now uh over a hundred thousand that are missing /.Unbelievable /.Uh we know that there \\'s over five hundred thousand registered /.So yes there \\'s a vast amount that are running uh through the system /.That \\'s a May of two thousand five um statistic /.but as far as those before that time and date /.Um Linda eh how much has this eh when I say changed your life I mean in addition to the obvious loss of your daughter but in terms of what you are doing everyday with your life /.both of you have devoted much of your lives to this cause now /.Linda why do n\\'t you tell me a little bit about what you \\'ve been doing /.Well um I \\'ve been working with um er pardon me Byron Dorgan Senator of North Dakota /.um working legislation on what has been uh called Dru \\'s Law which we hope will be a national sex +offender uh database through computer /.And um obviously we know that this nation is more and um they \\'re able to access cross you know state lines /.so I think it \\'s important that uh people of predators living amongst us across you know the country and be vigilant uh besides uh leaving the pressure on them /.Mhm /.Yeah /.Erin uh every time I listen to that tape of you um talking to uh your dau- I get chills /.Um was it at all uh cathartic for you to be able to stand across from him /?Definitely /.Definitely I to say what I said to him /.I needed to address him /.And I feel like I got it off my chest you know /.I hope to never ever see him again /.The whole trial process is really built around the defendant /.and um it was very important to me that I bring it back around and make it about Samantha because that \\'s what it was really about /.Do you watch these other stories uh in the news /.and does it just get your blood boiling as you see eh these cases where

I had n\\'t thought about that .Actually a shaved head is really hard to manage , is n\\'t it ?Do you have to shave it every day ?Right , yes .Um , when I \\'ve slept so much I ca n\\'t wake up , I just shave my head and I \\'m awake .And do you need to polish it somehow ?Then do you rub a little oil of some kind on it ?Oh , after I shave it I rub on a little oil .Is it cold in the winter ?Pretty cold .Do you wear a hat ?In the winter ?It forces me to wear a hat .That \\'s a question I \\'ve always wanted to ask .Um , I \\'m sure that there are many people when they introduce you , aside from saying Director Ye Daying who has shot such and such , they ca n\\'t avoid the cliche , they always have to say \" I \\'d like to introduce Marshall Ye Ting \\'s grandson . \"Your father , Ye Zhengming , was Marshall Ye Ting \\'s second child .Right .Oh !But today we \\'re telling Ye Daying \\'s story .Let \\'s start with when you were young .When you were young you were very naughty .Ye Daying was born in Changchun in 1958 .Although by that time his grandfather Ye Ting had been dead for 12 years , the Ye family maintained its status as a highly esteemed Communist household .The next year the entire family transferred to Beijing , and Ye Daying spent his childhood there .He and his little friends went fishing , raised dogs , hunted sparrows , chased ducks , and many years later these supremely happy memories are all preserved in his movies and plays .One , two , three , four .Ducks were the most precious asset in our village .The village mayor gave them all to me .The mayor said to me , there are eighty - six in all ;he had me check to see that there were none missing .But I never did count them all carefully .77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86Did you see ?Are there 86 of them ?Yes .Ye Daying \\'s mother , An Qi , was an educated woman who worked at the Changchun Film Studio .And his father , Ye Zhengming , was an outstanding son of the revolution .Because after the Wannan Incident Ye Zhengming and his father Ye Ting were imprisoned for two years in a Kuomnintang prison .But then , and for the same reasons , just after the Cultural Revolution started , Ye Zhengming was treated as a major capitalist roader .That year Ye Daying was just eight years old .His family \\'s sudden misfortune left the young Ye Daying with very disturbing memories .He changed from a very well - behaved child into a naughty child .From that time on he often did things that went beyond the norm , sometimes to protect himself and sometimes to take care of his family .Ye Daying just corrected us ; he said that Ye Ting should not be called Marshal Ye Ting but rather General Ye Ting .Right , right , right , General Ye Ting .Why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?Um , he died in \\'46 .That marshal , afterward , after Liberation , um , it was conferred on him , so only then --OK , we \\'ll call him General Ye Ting .Mm .Because ,Very naughty ?To what extent were you naughty then ?In fact I was a very well - behaved child .But I was , forced into it , , if you were n\\'t naughty there was no way to survive .What do you mean forced into it ?During the Cultural Revolution , , um , my family was considered capitalist roaders .So the kids then did n\\'t want to play with you , or they would tease you , that sort of thing .Mm .So you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,Why was that ?Was it because people for example would say that your father was such and such , or your family was such and such .Right .So it was because of that sort of thing ?Right , the majority of it was like that .Mm .Mm .Because you had to face them alone , OK , a dozen people who wanted to fight you .You had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough .So that was , the only way you could overcome them and get the upper hand .Mm .Were you tough ?Mm .Very tough .Tough enough to --Because , there was no way , if you were n\\'t tough that was it , , how could you manage .You were the son of capitalist roaders , , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it \\'s perfectly normal .Mm ., I remember one time , we were digging out an air - raid shelter , that --Those , good kids , they went there and threw stones .I did n\\'t dare defend myself , so I just had to endure it for quite a while .Mm .Finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on the head , And I got angry , so angry that I rushed out with a shovel and hit them with the shovel .Where did the shovel come from ?From digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right .Mm .So you picked up the shovel and rushed them .Did you crack somebody \\'s head open ?Mm , anyhow , yes , I cracked their head open , it was very tragic .All of a sudden nobody was making a sound .Very --Once I fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me .How many of them did you take out ?I hit one of them and that was enough .Nopbody went to get the schoolmaster or somebody \\'s father ?They did , and there was a huge fuss .Mm .Because when I was little , having a big fight like that .Mm .Anyhow , more or less , , on average , every two years I changed school , and that \\'s how it had to be .Mm .I remember one time -- Mm , also , when I was in fifth or sixth grade , someone yelled out , Down with Ye Zhengming , he was yelling at me , and I had to fight them .Mm .After the fight I went home , and my father was standing far away ., the factory , , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters Down with Ye Zhengming , , the slogan .Mm .I got accustomed to it while passing by at that time , and now when I think about it , it seems very much like a stage play .Mm .Back then I felt , looking at him standing so far away --I walked over to him , and he said , um , you really do n\\'t understand anything .At the time I felt like I had a grievance .And I felt , I was fighting for you , the people were cursing you , and I was fighting them .In fact that \\'s the way kids think .Mm .You think , you bastard .What you say does n\\'t count .you come after me and I \\'ll take you down .You come down , and I \\'ll take you down .If you have balls , you come on down .Come on down .Come down .Come down , come on , fight , fight , fight .I say you take a whack .Whack .I \\'m telling you , if you kill somebody you \\'ll pay with your life , do you understand ?, You \\'ve already handed him over .I sent someone .OK , OK , I sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at me .Come on , take a whack at me .Take a whack at me .Your dad knows who broke the window .Take a whack .Take a whack .Take a whack .Are n\\'t you willing to be friends with us ?Yes , I am .He says he \\'s willing .Did you hear ?He says he \\'s willing .Ok , that \\'s all right , let \\'s go play .This is a movie directed by Ye , called There \\'s a Place Called Wangjiazhan .Wangjiazhuang , right .This is obviously him as a boy , uh , a memory of his childhood life .Right .Right .Which child is you .Is this child you , or is that child you ?Actually we should be accurate ; this child \\'s experiences ,So this child ,Um , right , right , right , because once , IMy father was denounced , and then the rebels took us , took that child to see .Mm .They denounced my father , so I was very indignant ,They let a lot of people expose my father ,Mm .Then the day after I took a kitchen knife and ran over to their home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that I \\'d hack the guy up .A kitchen knife ; a knife from your kitchen at home .Oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .Then I was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n\\'t just hack people up .But I had already said it .What did you say ?said I have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like this child .But , those adults standing around reasoned with me , said look , you do n\\'t understand this .If you do this , you \\'ll stir up more trouble , and then wo n\\'t your dad be even worse off ?In fact when they said that , my mind had already eased .I could not lose the face this way , , So then I ran over and took a whack at the door , to get an excuse for myself .Was it all ruined ? The door --I slashed it twice .Um , was n\\'t there any consequence ?Mm , there was no consequence , , I just let the adults reason with me .Mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .It , had a great influence on me .Including that village , that environment , it \\'s all very familiar to you .More or less , very close to me , this is a novel of .Mm .Mm ., the reason I like it is because , um , it brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories .Mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in Beijing .What year was it that you moved to Shanghai ?How old were you at that time ?, In \\'69 I was 11 years old .Mm .Mm , well .In \\'69 at the age of 11 you went from Beijing to Shanghai .Mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n\\'t completely passed .Mm , as he puts it , looking at it now , some of the memories can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .I went there every day and then they suspended classes , , so I could n\\'t go to school , could n\\'t go to class .Mm .So , later I remember there was -- Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you \\'ll take up arms and teach yourselves .A lot of people were very happy , very excited , because they were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?Right , but the problem --Because , I had never studied well ,In 1966 the Great Cultural Revolution came , and at that time Ye Daying \\'s family moved from Beijing to Shanghai to live .His father Ye Zhengming was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .And the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of Ye Daying \\'s life .He was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .When you got to Shanghai the environment changed ; did n\\'t your whole person change ?After I got to Shanghai , , settling into , , that ,All that time , from \\'69 to \\'76 , I graduated from senior middle school , it all took place there .Mm .At that time in school , there were some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in that class ?Right , right , , see , like study classes to educate good kids .What kind of people were in your class ?Um .Anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say they were little hooligans , they were all mixed in together in that class , and there were also some who had problems at home .Mm .All of them , and every day I went there , and the classes were suspended , , so they did n\\'t let me go to school , did n\\'t let me go to class .Mm .So , afterward , I remember there was Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you \\'ll take up arms and teach yourselves .Lots of fun .Mm .So I was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .In fact it was n\\'t that we did n\\'t study , I think it was ,This class really helped me a lot , , sometimes in my life I think about this ,Mm .That period was both a happy and a fun time .Because I was a good egg .In this I go against the grain .Um , the thing is , , they \\'re all the same .If you \\'re bad , you do what you want , and so , you \\'re honest and so it \\'s easy to be free .Plus when you yourself have already decided that you \\'re a bad kid , then , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you \\'re completely liberated and free .I think that --Um , of course today we say , at that time , um , in that class of ours , they were n\\'t all necessarily bad kids .Mm .They just were n\\'t like normal kids ., it was like a brotherhood .Ah , and we did some things that were out of bounds .Mm , we helped each other .Very sincere , very sincere and good .When he was in that class , Ye Daying received patient teaching every day .At that time he encountered the first love of his life that still remains fresh in his memory .This girl became the only light in Ye Daying \\'s dark life for several years .In those days if a middle school student liked a fellow - student , how did he go about expressing that ?Um .When I was a school kid , for example , Um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , I liked her .Mm .I always felt , um , she can , give you more on your plate , put more things on your plate for you to eat .And then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together .Mm .It was ,So already you could -- Go see a movie ; I thought ,That was it , that was it .You just want to go see the movie , you do n\\'t worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , --So you went to the movies with this girl ?Yes .Do you still remember what movies you saw ?The Flower Girl .I still remember that now .Mm .She cried as hard as she could .So seeing The Flower Girl was the equivalent of seeing Titanic now .Oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .Yes , crying her eyes out , a big film like that .At the time I thought I would n\\'t cry .But the people all around were crying , and I thought if I did n\\'t cry it would look bad .So then you cried .So then I thought , I should let my emotions go .Um , how was the girl , was she very pretty ?, now I remember that she was very pretty , mm .Mm .She was a very good student .Ha ha , this --How was it she liked you ?At that time we did n\\'t talk about it , if two people gave each other the eye and felt it was right , then ,Gave each other the eye , while you were in the class you gave each other the eye ., so , when we were in class , for example you ,I remember how it happened , yes .Um . When we went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .Mm .Mm .So then , we \\'d each pick up a piece of chalk and toss the chalk back and forth . And throw spitballs .I threw it at someone else but missed , and it hit her .The result was that she turned her head to look .And she looked at you angrily .I thought , uh-oh , the expression in her eyes was like she would forgive you , that kind of feeling .I thought wow , it \\'s so wonderful , that kind of feeling .Mm .That \\'s how it was , I should say .It was like that ?Mm .Many years later , afterward , we graduated from senior middle school , and I was still going to see her .Mm .The --, so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .You graduated from middle school in \\'73 .\\'74 .Mm .Graduated from midle school in \\'74 .Mm , that female schoolmate went to the Shanghai suburbs to live and work .Right , right , yes .Ye Daying went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were , forty - some yuan ?Mm , when I started it was a technical school .Then at first it was 13 yuan , the first year 13 yuan ; the second year it was 15 yuan , and the third year it was 41 yuan .Mm .Mm .41 yuan , at the time , for him , it was , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money .It was a lot of money .In 1976 , there were two happy events in the Ye family .The first was that his father , Ye Zhengming , was released and reunited with his family that he had been separated from for three years .The second event was that Ye Daying had his 18th birthday and became an adult .With the turn for the better in his father \\'s political circumstances , Ye Daying left behind his violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking .In 1978 the big news was that the college entrance exams would be reinstated nationwide , and people of Ye Daying \\'s age were thrilled .However , at this time Ye Daying , facing this opportunity that would change his fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .You thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?Oh my , in fact , \\'78 , for me , was an especially depressing time .Mm .Mm .Up to then , um , I had never thought about the future .Mm .I thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -LRB- factory -RRB- worker .In society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead .Um , in \\'78 suddenly they reinstated the college entrance exams .At that time , in \\'78 , I was 20 .A lot of people were happy , very excited , because they reinstated the college entrance exams ; why were you feeling depressed ?Right , but the problem was , , Because , I had never done well in school .So right off I felt that I was finished , --Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school , , compared to me , they had a future , um , they could stand out .Mm .So I was hopeless , right off I was feeling down .Very clearly a --If you wanted to take the exams , what kind of score did you think you \\'d get .I did n\\'t take the exams , I did n\\'t have the nerve , I did n\\'t try , so --, the extraordinary thing was , at that time my mom was attending the film institute , she was an instructor there .Mm .Mm , I had n\\'t thought , , that I would work in the movie .Mm ., um , she wanted to send the recruitment announcement to a friend \\'s house .Mm .So then I --One day she sent me to deliver it , and so I picked it up and read it , and once I read it , oh ! The directing department of the film institute , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and I thought wow ! This is just the ticket .Let \\'s run off to try and see .I thought you \\'ve loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , I want to be a director .No , I did n\\'t , no .It was just because there was no English exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .Right , it was very simple .Mm .One more thing , because in \\'78 , the Beijing Film Institute was recruiting students in Shanghai --Right .So , Ye Daying went to take the exams for the film institute , but did n\\'t pass the exams .His mother , An Qi , had never thought that Ye Daying would sign up to take the exam for her work unit , the Beijing Film Institute .But Ye Daying in fact failed when he took the reinstated exam .Although it was the first time he had taken the exam , it left Ye Daying even more convinced that movies were something he could do .The next year , 21 - year - old Ye Daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at the Xi\\'an Film Studio .Being an actor was not his goal ; he hoped rather to get into the directing profession .At that time you especially admired directors , right ?Mm , because after I got to the Xi\\'an Film Studio , um , I discovered I had the shakes when I got on stage .Mm .Mm . Now , here chatting with you , I feel , um , it does n\\'t matter .Even today , in front of the lens , I \\'m a nervous wreck .Mm , very tense .Did you act then ?Of course , every day we had to , um , it was n\\'t just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that .I thought , this is definitely not working .Just getting on stage gave you the shakes .Then , , no , it was n\\'t my thing , this , I could n\\'t find out why , and besides in those days ,Um , it was in \\'80 that I went to the Xi\\'an Film Studio ,Mm .At that time , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing .And I \\'m not that kind of person , so I could n\\'t get my bearings .So then at the same time when I saw that Teng Wenji , he was probably thirty - some years old , he was the previous generation to us , very stubborn .Mm .Mm .That projecting force of his , I thought wow , , that \\'s really good .He could really project .Because ultimately , there , I gradually realized this .Mm .And I would be in the audience and see him directing on site .Mm .Mm , I could see how they worked .In fact in the beginning the attraction to movies was all these things , I thought it was really a bunch of fluff , I thought , that \\'s really fun , that \\'s really interesting .I thought who was stubborn , then I wanted to be that kind of person , but that did n\\'t mean I knew anything about that profession .So no one ever came looking for you to do a play ?At that time --Mm , no one ever came looking -- .They looked , but it was always just for an extra ., you did n\\'t even have any lines .Mm .That Xi\\'an Incident thing , I played an extra once .There was a guy playing Zhang Xueliang , and I played his secretary going in to report to him , and I did it a few times but I was always in the wrong place .What were your lines supposed to be ?It was \" reporting , a telegram \" that sort of thing .So you --So I had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful .So after I gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing .So the old director , Cheng Yin , um ,Mm .He would say , this is An Qi \\'s son , why is he like that ?Do you remember how many takes you did ?Oh , a lot .I think it was something like ten plus times .It was too , I \\'d walk badly and turn like that ., I attended that class for half a year , um , um and then I got sick .Um , I got , , an inflammation of the central nervous system , so my whole body was paralyzed .Your whole body was paralyzed ?Right .Your whole body was paralyzed ?Right . I was paralyzed for ten months .So you could n\\'t move at all .I could n\\'t move at all .When it started , my leg went numb , then my hand went numb , and then it started cross over , like that , and then slowly , slowly , slowly I could n\\'t move .What \\'s the scientific name of the disease ?It \\'s called Guillain - Barre Syndrome .It \\'s named after a foreigner .Mm .Ahem , if naming it somewhat common , it \\'s , a paralysis of the central nervous system , um , it goes from the nerve endings to the flesh , and , then it turns into myasthenia .And how did you get better , later ?Hormones .You took hormones .Um , , every day I had a transfusion .Mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat .Mm .Very fat .I \\'m so fat now , but compared to then it \\'s much better , in fact .At that time how fat were you ?Yah .Getting so fat , it was this , if I looked down I could see my own cheeks , so I thought I was really fat .What do you mean ?If I just look down , my cheeks are right here .But after they finished with the hormones , I gradually got better .Mm .The flesh all atrophied , um .If you look at when I was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --Later , based on that , it all evaporated .I \\'ve heard it said that that Wang Shuo novel , which we later saw as a television play --Sometimes , oh , right .Mm .Get some fun .Get some fun .The language in that , the part Wang Zhiwen played , the disease he got is about the same as your disease , is n\\'t it ?Right , right , right , right .So sometimes , oh , it was me and Wang Shuo , together , it was , um , in \\'89 .Mm , together , um , wrote a -- .Aye , the script I wanted , the novel he wrote , um , that piece we created together .Mm .Therefore , at that time , we were talking and talking to shoot , an urban love story , tell a love story , so he took me , at that time , , more or less that story , as background .Mm .Then after I went back to Beijning , when we made arrangement and were eating together , I saw Wang Shuo for the first timeThen , when I saw him for the first time , Wang Shuo was holding a book in his arms , a book , that was Floating on the Sea , that novel he wrote , it was a sample .Mm .Gave it to me , and I took it back to school to read .I read it and wow , that day , I thought he would be able --Our generation could really find ourselves , I mean --Um , in the end I knew we --Why we studied movies , um , and why wrote things , expressing one \\'s own kind of thing is the most accurate personYe Daying had already read Wang Shuo \\'s novel Love the Hard Way , and the story and the style it was written in made a profound impression on him .He sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express .Later he was introduced by a friend , and Ye Daying met the author of the novel , Wang Shuo , at the film institute .That was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today .How many plays did you collaborate on ?Today , U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen promised to catch and punish those responsible for the bombing of the `` Cole \\'\\' and defended the Navy \\'s decision to refuel ships in Yemen as investigators continued their day at work .Morton Dean reports it \\'s a difficult day for the sailors remaining on board .The stressful , monumental task for the crew on the U.S. carrier suffered a setback .The ship began to take on water and lost electrical power again .A difficult time became even more difficult .It led to the cancellation of a memorial service planned for the 17 sailors who lost their lives .Details are becoming known about the damage , most obvious , the huge hole , but also the deck is buckled .Even the superstructure is damaged .Hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed .Rear Admiral Mark Fitzgerald , who visited the Cole , was stunned by the damage .I wo n\\'t tell you whether the ship is going to sink or not sink , but there was considerable damage to the ship .According to U.S. officials here tonight , the most important questions about the attack remain unanswered .Any details or speculation on who specifically , we do n\\'t know that at this point .With well over 100 U.S. investigators now in Yemen , the search for evidence is now fully under way .It \\'s been officially designated `` Operation Determined Response , \\'\\' and that suggests several things that the U.S. , of course , is determined to discover who carried out the bombing and that any group who helped plan the attack faces a response from the U.S. military .The U.S. believes there are anti-American terror groups based in Yemen .Half the population lives in settlements with 500 people or less , and senior U.S. officials here say the government , although friendly to the United States , does not have full control over the entire country .Yemen \\'s President has repeatedly said an internal explosion rocked the `` USS Cole , \\'\\' but tomorrow

flown home , but in Yemen , the search for those responsible for the bombing continues .Investigators turned up new evidence and more leads today .ABC \\'s John Miller reports .Investigators have searched at least half a dozen homes around the port of Aden including this one , trying to retrace the movements of what they believe may be six or more suspects .This house on Al Zaharah Street half a mile from the port is where investigators believe the bomb was built into the boat that carried it .Just after the men moved in , neighbors say they erected a metal corrugated wall to block the neighbors \\' view of the yard .Investigators say the men who lived here worked on the boat behind these walls in the last few days of their stay almost constantly .At first , neighbors were curious , but later they complained about the noise .On the day of the bombing , neighbors saw the boat leaving through these gates pulled by a Nissan 4 x 4 truck .The trip from the house to the harbor was only about a mile , then six miles by water to the spot where the American destroyer was refueling .Today , FBI agents and divers were collecting evidence near the place they believe the boat was lowered into the water just before the attack on the `` USS Cole \\'\\' which killed 17 sailors and two suicide bombers .Investigators have come up with a series of names of possible suspects found on papers in the houses and cars they searched .In some cases , they have some names .They have not been able to verify whether they \\'re accurate , true names .In other cases , I do n\\'t believe they have identities yet .Yemeni sources say some of the bombers may have used ID cards issued by a government registration center 35 miles from Aden .Today , at the walled - in headquarters of the government security agency , the manager of that center and several clerks who worked there were among dozens who have been detained and questioned .Investigators are aware that a few weeks before the bombing , accused terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden released a videotape calling for holy war against Americans in the Gulf .American investigators also say the way the bombers organized the plot in Aden has stark similarities to the way Bin Laden \\'s cells have operated in the past , but , they concede , while they are closer to learning the names of the bombers , they are still a long way from knowing or proving who sent them .John Miller , ABC News , Aden .We have an exclusive report tonight about the `` USS Cole , \\'\\' and an identical attack that was planned , but failed , several months earlier .Here \\'s ABC \\'s John M Wethy .ABC News has learned that the terrorists who attacked the `` USS Cole \\'\\' originally planned to hit a different American warship in the same port ten months earlier .The attack was to be part of a worldwide effort during celebration of the millennium that included targets in Jordan and Seattle .Intelligence sources say the target was to be a destroyer , the `` USS The Sullivans , \\'\\' which refueled in Yemen \\'s port of Aden in January .Sources tell ABC News that a suspect who has been in custody for several weeks told Yemeni investigators that his group failed in their attack because their small boat , overloaded with explosives , sank just off the beach .The suspect said it took months to repackage and redesign the load of high explosives that was eventually used against `` the Cole . \\'\\'John M Wethy , ABC News , the Pentagon .Good evening .That call to order you just heard reverberates through the Supreme Court every day that the justices convene , but today was no everyday session .Never before has the United States Supreme Court taken up a case that could decide a presidential election .It did today .That session of the Supreme Court and two defeats for Al Gore in Florida courts dominate the news today .We start with the U.S. Supreme Court , specifically at issue , an appeal from the campaign of George W. Bush that the Florida Supreme Court had exceeded its authority when it ruled Florida counties could have more time to hand - count ballots .Throughout an hour and a half of argument , the justices were aggressive in peppering lawyers with questions , and they seemed interested on two issues .Was there a federal issue involved that would even require the U.S. Supreme Court to rule ? and if so , did the Florida Supreme Court improperly rewrite Florida law , as Governor Bush contends ?A sure sign of the historic nature of the day \\'s proceeding , for the first time ever , the court immediately released an audiotape of the arguments .But in the courtroom , listening in person was ABC \\'s Jackie Judd .Even now , hours after that hearing ended , there are still protesters circling the Supreme Court .As boisterous as the protesters were , nothing intruded on the ritual inside .The chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States .The courtroom was packed .Al Gore \\'s top campaign aides , his children , Republican senators and congressmen , they were all there .God save the United States and this honorable court .First up , Ted Olson lawyer for George W. Bush , laying out the campaign \\'s main claim .Olson made it through only 56 seconds of his arguments before a justice broke in .Well , Mr. Olson --Sandra Day O\\'Connor , often the swing vote on this court , demanded to know why the court even had a role in this case .Olson argued that a century - old federal statute prevents laws governing an election from being created after the fact which , he claimed , is just what the Florida court did , and also , that the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures , not the courts , the right to choose electors .Of all the justices it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg who seemed most sympathetic to the Florida Supreme Court .Midway through the hearing , Chief Justice Rehnquist seemed to scold his colleagues for being too talkative when he made an unusual offer to the lawyer representing Florida \\'s Attorney General .And so it went on .Laurence Tribe , Gore \\'s attorney , said the state court did nothing illegal .It simply provided a way for a close election to be examined .Justice O\\'Connor again , but this time suggesting the state court had overstepped its authority and perhaps there was a federal case here .Justice Antonin Scalia also pressed Tribe .He said the state court relied on the Florida Constitution to draft its decision , excluding state lawmakers and that violated the U.S. Constitution .It was Justice Breyer who asked the most straightforward question of all .What happens if the court rules in favor of Bush ?The answer from the Secretary of State \\'s lawyer was , Bush wins and all the litigation in Florida ends .Not everyone agrees .They say that no matter which way the court rules , it will not provide nearly so much finality to this presidential election .Charlie ?Jackie Judd at the Supreme Court .Our thanks .The `` USS Cole \\'\\' has arrived back at the Mississippi shipyard where she was built .ABC \\'s John M. Wethy reports tonight before the attack on the ship , the crew failed to take at least 25 % of the 80 different steps to protect the ship before landing in Yemen .An investigation is already under way .The ship \\'s captain is going to take a lot of heat for the 17 sailors who died .The ship will sail again .After George W. Bush is sworn in , Bill Clinton will head to New York .The President has said he and his wife , now a New York senator will spend weekends at their house in Chappaqua .Mr. Clinton will also spend time at his presidential library in Arkansas .He says he will come to Washington , `` every now and then . \\'\\'Thanks for joining us .Here \\'s our story this half hour --There \\'s dancing in the streets of Belgrade as angry demonstrations have turned into celebrations .Tens of thousands of people crowded the streets of the Yugoslavian capital today after the apparent overthrow of President Slobodan Milosevic .Yesterday , protesters stormed key government buildings and seized Serb state television in Belgrade .Russia has joined the West in its support of opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica .Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov congratulated Kostunica on his election victory .He also gave him a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin .Putin says he hopes the opposition leader will do `` everything possible to overcome the internal political crisis \\'\\' in Yugoslavia .Russia was the last European power to withhold support for the opposition .The man who lost power in Yugoslavia finally surfaced today .Slobodan Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov .Ivanov says Milosevic told him he plans to remain in Serbia and continue to run its largest political party .Indeed Milosevic still considers himself to be President , according to his brother Borislav .In an interview with CNN , Borislav Milosevic accused Western nations of supporting the demonstrations and said his brother has no plans to leave the city .Regardless of how many votes Mr. Kostunica received , the actions that took place last night are vandalism .It \\'s violence .It should n\\'t have happened .That \\'s not democracy .The opposition did n\\'t accept the ruling of the constitutional court and began to storm the parliament , which was not being defended , and inflicted huge material damage , but it also did more damage to our institutions .The next step in the transition to a new government is for the Yugoslav parliament to convene .A commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to Belgrade for a special session .Alessio Vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of parliament will have to travel to Belgrade from Montenegro .What is going on right now is intense negotiations with all the members of parliament that were elected on September trying to get the majority needed in order to swear in Vojislav Kostunica as the next President of Yugoslavia .With the events of the past week in Yugoslavia , the world is getting to know the name of Vojislav Kostunica .Jonathan Mann takes a look at the man and his politics .Unlike President Milosevic , he was not a Communist in the long years when party membership was the key to power .He was not among the prominent opposition figures who have struggled against each other almost as hard as the regime .He is an orthodox Serb nationalist , but he supports truer democracy for his country and better relations with its neighbors and the West .Kostunica is a soft - spoken and uncharismatic figure who spent years building the Democratic Party of Serbia and gathering only modest support .After ten years , people know what are the differences between Milosevic \\'s policies and ours , what Milosevic was saying and promising and what the opposition parties and I myself was saying in these years and how I was behaving .Kostunica is 56 , an expert on constitutional law who lives with his wife and pets in a Belgrade apartment .He was fired from his job teaching law in 1974 for his opposition to the policies of the Tito government .He refused an offer to return in 1989 because of his opposition to the Milosevic regime , and he rejects much from the West as well -- the Dayton peace accord , Western sanctions on Yugoslavia , and the war crimes tribunal .In the months before the election , he was careful to distinguish between his support for European aid projects tied to reform and U.S. efforts , which he describes as unhelpful , even to the opposition .I know what the support means when we get from European Union , the programs like energy for democracy , school for democracy .Those small projects .Here we get nothing in advance , just a political support which consists of nothing , and which is mostly used and abused and manipulated by the regime , saying they are just NATO parties , as is often said by regime , they are not having their own policy .Jonathan Mann , CNN .We \\'ll be following the events in Yugoslavia all day .To learn more about the situation , just click on our website at headlinenews.com .The United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution condemning what it calls `` acts of violence , especially the excessive use of force against Palestinians . \\'\\'U.S. diplomats had opposed wording which apparently blamed the new round of clashes on an Israeli opposition leader \\'s visit to a shrine venerated by both sides .The Security Council vote was unanimous , with the United States abstaining .President Clinton may travel to North Korea in an attempt to improve relations with that country .The announcement comes after two days of talks between American and North Korean leaders in Washington .Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has accepted an invitation to visit North Korea and meet with leader Kim Jong -

back tears .We \\'re watching from the sidelines .You can just imagine what these people must be thinking and how antsy they must be .Got to think the last five minutes must feel like five days as they \\'ve spent ten months on the water .Just about to come home .Sense the anticipation there beginning to build on those docks .Friend of mine in Richmond , Virginia , on the radio up there WRBA

across Connecticut in early April .Police say Jennifer O\\'Conner , a Connecticut woman with a history of psychiatric problems confessed to shooting her daughter 7 , while the 7 - year - old girl lay sleeping .O\\'Conner told police she could no longer cope with her daughter \\'s learning , disability Prps Sara Dade three days later .Thomas , owner a local gun and motorcycle shop , said he felt

censorship .China today blacked out a CNN interview that was critical of the Chinese government \\'s handling of the SARs epidemic and of the country \\'s health care system .China requires foreign broadcasters to use a Chinese satellite to serve their country .Until last month it was routinely blocking almost all reports about Sars in China , a practice that has produced intense global criticism .The British Broadcasting Company has also faced the censorship in China .In 1993 Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling stake in China \\'s Star TV satellite system .In 1994 the BBC World Service broadcasts were pulled from Star .China was offended by the BBC \\'s news content and demanded that STAR TV remove it or lose permission to broadcast in China .A year later Murdoch bought the rest of Star TV that he did not own .Rupert Murdoch \\'s News Corp. has an extensive presence , of course in this country .That presence may be expanding soon , if the FCC eases some of its broadcast rules .Murdoch has lobbied hard for those changes .They would allow him to buy even more U.S. television stations .Next month the FCC is likely to accommodate him .Murdoch today promised that if the rules are changed he will limit future purchases to a few of what he calls sizable markets .Let \\'s talk a little bit more about what the Navy does to prevent such tragedies .We were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .I \\'ll try to explain it the best I can from what I remember from being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln \\'\\' .This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the Navy does with regard to prevention ., every sailor that \\'s entering the Navy does take a swim test .They learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .Also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment .Usually twice a day , they \\'re practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly .They also wear float coats .You can see them here .The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .Everything is color coordinated .You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate .They also have a manual device so if the toggles do n\\'t work they can blow air into the inflation device .They have dive goggles and they \\'re able to find them .It also has a strobe light and a whistle .Also such location devices , some ships have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to , let the rescuer locate them .Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout the ship , all around the ship , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of the ship , not all around the entire ship , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .Now let \\'s talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .You will hear a P.A. announcement around the entire ship , there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly .A ship - wide search will happen if they do n\\'t see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously .Also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .Inside those helicopters rescue swimmers .If indeed the man overboard is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .If the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .The search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search .Why call it off ?There \\'s a number of reasons to look at .Depending on the water temperature , it \\'s very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they \\'ve exhausted all resources by that time .Anyway , we \\'ll continue to follow what \\'s happening on the `` USS Nassau \\'\\' as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors .Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas scheduled to meet today , their second chance now to discuss the Bush administration \\'s road map for Mideast peace .Both sides will meet with President Bush when he arrives in the Mideast next week .Our Jerusalem

cruise ship ship .Canada TV has the story and some dramatic pictures .Reporter :With winds bliping at more than 100 kilometers an hour , three men desperately cling to their sinking fishing boat .The crew sent out a distress call after it started taking on water .Suddenly we realized water came into the engine room and it was rising and they started to pump , of course , and they pumped and pumped and the water came more and more and more .Reporter :The ship was sinking by the second , and as the waves pounded against them , waiting for help was their only option .Their life raft had already

electoral votes .It \\'s being fought over hard .With a look at how the candidates are getting out the vote there , here \\'s NBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders .The image of Florida , both fact and fiction .A great getaway , a state where a mouse wields more power than a tropical paradise .While the mild winters make this comfortable living for almost three million seniors , the largest elderly population in the United States , this year it is not the weather drawing Al Gore and George W. Bush to the Sunshine State .Both candidates list 25 reasons to keep coming back , Florida \\'s 25 electoral votes .Polls show Florida is still up for grabs .Both candidates have been here almost equally .In fact , it \\'s almost I dare you politics .Each of them dares the other one to spend less time , money , and energy than they are at their own peril .Elderly voters once again in Florida , the most important voting bloc because they actually vote more than any other group .In this election , 45 % of those going to the voting booth are expected to be over the age of 65 .The issue most important to them , Social Security .Pay down the nation \\'s debt , strengthen Social Security , cut taxes for middle class family , save our environment .Experience .Vision .Values .Al Gore .Why does Al Gore say one thing when the truth is another ?His attacks on George Bush \\'s Social Security plan , exaggerations .The truth , nonpartisan analysis confirms George Bush \\'s plan sets aside $ 2.4 trillion to strengthen Social Security .Both candidates repeatedly talking about that one issue , but in Florida where there are more than 550 children born every day , families drive the other campaign issues .Polls show education , the environment , and the candidate \\'s character will influence who voters choose .And in this diverse state with a 15 % Hispanic population , both candidates courting their votes in ways not seen in any previous election .Following both conventions , Gore and Bush granted their first live TV interviews to this man .His name , Jorge Ramos , the Tom Brokaw of Spanish language news .The race gets really , really close , and let \\'s suppose that states like Florida and Illinois might decide the election .maybe , maybe Hispanic votes might decide , too , who would be the next President of the United States .The largest Hispanic voting bloc of Florida , Republican voters who do not seem to be crossing the party line .Gore wanted the young Cuban boy , Elian Gonzalez to stay in this country .Joe Lieberman brings Gore support he probably would have gotten here anyway .Sizable Jewish and African - American voting blocs .Of the 10 largest states , Florida is the most Republican .The Republican governor here , Jeb Bush was once expected to deliver his brother this state .The managers of both campaigns saying in the end , the wipper may simply be determined by who gets more people to the voting booth .Kerry Sanders , NBC News , Anaheim .There was , of course , a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over the weekend of this trial going on in the courtroom in Florida , and , of course , among the teams of lawyers on the Bush side , one of the leaders , Ben Ginsberg , one of the lawyers who argued the case in Leon County Circuit Court .He \\'s with us tonight , victorious in Tallahassee , Florida , and Ben , whatever the outcome today , and you were on the upside , you are forced now to go along with the appeals process as is the right of the Gore team .What is your reaction to the work that will cause ?Well , I mean , we \\'re certainly prepared to brief all the issues .I think that the circuit court judge , Judge Sauls gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of Florida law .Well , let \\'s talk about your statement earlier today that the Vice President -- I guess you were asked should the Vice President concede , and you answered , the Vice President should do what \\'s best for the United States .Is that what you \\'re trying to say ?Well , sure .I mean , I think that all the people involved in this unique situation , the first time a presidential election in our history has been contested , Brian , need to do the right thing , and I \\'m sure do the right thing , as they see fit .Do you think the judge there , in addition to just giving out his ruling at the end of the court session today , he went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why he turned down the Gore case .Do you think his method there was to try to make this more or less appeal proof ?Well , I think what he did was addressed the situation as it exists in Florida and addressed the contingencies that were raised in the voluminous briefs that he had , not only from the two party candidates involved , but also of the interveners who were in the case .As you know , the Democratic line throughout is they wo n\\'t be happy until every vote is counted , and we could n\\'t help but notice , should we call it a rhetorical device you used when talking to reporters this afternoon .Pause and listen along with us to the following piece of videotape .Those ballots have been counted not once on election night but twice in the recount and how many did you say there were ?10,750 --If you know the exact number , does n\\'t that mean they \\'ve been counted ?So I do n\\'t suppose that was any accident on your part ?Well , they have been making this point throughout these proceedings that these ballots have never been counted , and that is factually not true .They have been counted on election night -- they \\'ve been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not the case that those ballots have failed to be counted by anyone .Ben , for better or worse , you are forced now to follow the Gore team as they take you on a kind of trail of appeal here .If you were asked to predict whether this stops at the Florida or U.S. Supreme Court , what would your prediction be ?I think it \\'s one of those situations where I would have predicted all , Brian .I think that the decisions are not ours to make .We \\'ll be involved in all the legal processes obviously as long as the Gore campaign keeps them up , no matter how long that takes .Ben Ginsberg , attorney for the Bush team , victorious today in Tallahassee .Thank you very much , after a long day , for being with us tonight .Thanks , Brian .In the waters off the coast of Yemen , two urgent missions tonight collecting evidence from the suicide bombing and retrieving bodies still buried in debris .316 were aboard the `` USS Cole \\'\\' when the terrorists struck .Dozens were injured .17 were killed .Our coverage begins with NBC \\'s Joe Johns .A plane carrying the bodies of five dead American sailors from the `` USS Cole \\'\\' arrived today at Dover Air Force Base , as the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the Department of Defense and the FBI arrived in Yemen .Their mission -- to continue the search for evidence and suspects in the explosion .Also on the way , equipment to lift the `` Cole \\'\\' out of the water and specialists to help retrieve the bodies of those trapped and presumed dead .We know there are spaces that are inaccessible .We know there are some remains in those spaces .We need to get in those and locate the remains that we anticipate finding there .Though the work was only beginning , a top Justice Department official in Washington predicted the outcome of the investigation .I \\'m confident that we will be able to determine who was behind the bombing and that those people , those organizations , will be held accountable , they will be punished .This critical phase of the investigation must be conducted both above and beneath the water on a tight time line .They \\'ll want to get in there quickly because one of the problems when you \\'re dealing with seawater is that it will have an adverse effect on your evidence .To further speed up the process , the FBI has now activated the Strategic Information and Operation Center in Washington , conceived after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers .On the diplomatic front , the U.S. said the government of Yemen is cooperating with the investigation , though that country \\'s President disputes charges that his nation is a haven for terrorists .The Justice Department says no group or individual has been ruled out as a suspect , though many expect that whoever gets the blame will eventually be tied to the terrorist Osama bin Laden .And the grieving continued today at the Naval Academy \\'s football game against Notre Dame .A moment of silence to remember the victims of this terrorist act .Joe Johns , NBC News .The `` USS Cole \\'\\' is on its long journey home tonight , sitting atop a rescue ship , and now , for the first time , its open wound fully visible .NBC \\'s Jim Miklaszewski tonight at the Pentagon with an exclusive report on the damage done and the difficulty in finding those responsible .Jim ?What \\'s the latest there ?New pictures reveal the sheer power of that terrorist bomb that ripped through the `` USS Cole . \\'\\'For the first time , with the `` Cole \\'\\' out of the water , the full impact of the catastrophic blast clearly visible .In these photos obtained by NBC News , the damage much larger than first imagined , extending well below the water line .Workers on deck dwarfed by the 40 x 60 - foot gaping wound .Large sections of the hull buckled inward .Crewman Sean Powell , back home in Florida , says inside the `` Cole , \\'\\' it was chaos , it got dark , we lost power , ship started to list , that \\'s what scared everybody .Despite the devastating damage , Navy officials predict the `` Cole \\'\\' can be repaired for about $ 150 million , and put back into service .Justice Department officials say in Yemen , the FBI \\'s investigation is dead in the water .Senior U.S. officials tell NBC News the Yemen government has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind the `` Cole \\'\\' attack .Evidence is either withheld or tampered with .A surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the attack was so heavily edited , it did n\\'t even show the blast itself .Why ?Yemen is a terrorist hotbed , and some members of President Saleh \\'s own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists .It \\'s hard to see exactly why it is that the President there would ever want to cooperate with the United States and possibly put himself in jeopardy .Reporter :And even though cooperation from Yemen is at a standstill , U.S. officials tell NBC News that they are making substantial progress in the investigation and are fully confident they will get enough evidence to retaliate against those responsible .Tom ?Thanks very much , NBC \\'s Jim Miklaszewski tonight .The nation \\'s highest court will take up the case next week .That development may not be as significant as it seems .Joining me now is law professor Rick Pildes , a consultant to NBC News .Could a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court settle this case once and for all ?At this stage , any decision from the U.S. Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to provide a final resolution of this election dispute .Indeed , the issue is so narrow now before the Supreme Court that whichever way the court rules , it will likely have only the most marginal impact on what \\'s going on in Florida .Even if the Bush campaign prevails before the Supreme Court , it simply means we will move more quickly into the contest phase of the litigation or the next stage of the litigation .But you believe the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court just decided to hear this case is a partial victory for both Bush and Gore .It is a partial victory for both sides .For the last two weeks , the central constitutional argument the Bush campaign has been making to the federal courts is , stop these manual recounts now , they violate the Constitution .The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear that part of the case , agreeing with all the other federal judges who have unanimously held that this is not the proper time for federal court intervention .So in that sense , a victory for the Gore campaign .For the Bush campaign , a victory in the willingness of the Supreme Court to play some role in overseeing the Florida system and the Florida judicial decision making process .Whatever the Supreme Court decides this time , you say this case could come back before the U.S. Supreme Court again ?John , if the Supreme Court of the United States is to play a final and decisive role in this dispute , that role is going to come at the end of the Florida judicial process , not at this stage .Law professor Rick Pildes , thank you .From BBC News in London , I am James Cawling for The World .The Yugoslav Army has given its support to President - elect Vojislav Kostunica .Earlier he had an hour long meeting with former President Slobodan Milosevic .It \\'s the first meeting since Milosevic was ousted by a popular revolt .He conceded defeat and congratulated his successor .Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says , the lifting of international sanctions against Serbia can now be discussed .Our sanctions regime is not against the people of Serbia , it was against Milosevic , and if Milosevic is gone then there are many ways that the sanctions regime can be changed and lifted and adjusted .Albright says Milosevic must not be allowed to maintain any position of power .Earlier Russia also recognized Kostunica as Yugoslavia \\'s new leader .Visiting Foreign Minister Evan Holf told Milosevic his time is up .This is The World .I am Tony

native China and he fled the country in 1988 .He settled in France becoming a French citizen two years ago .Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons in France .Professor Lee , I gather you know the man and know his work .Tell us a little bit about him , Who is he and why did he flee China .Gao Xingjian is quite an interesting writer because in some senses he differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in the West today .I would say that the great difference about Gao Xingjian is that he actually received a university education .He was educated in French , so has a very good knowledge of French literature and it is very much French literature that has influenced his own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse him of blind worship of Western models .Sartre is a big man in Mr. Xingjian \\'s life , is n\\'t he ?I would say so that Sartre has been a quite a big influence .I think the other influences would be Samuel Beckett , the Irish and French language writer , Unesco .These are models and , of course , all of these writers are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century .Well , this is very interesting because Mr. Gao left China before Tianenmen .He wrote a play , in particular about the events there .Would you say that his influences may be more French literary then they were his own immediate life experience ?I would say both , in fact , because the first play that he wrote that made him famous was a play that dates from 1981 , which was actually called ` Bus Stop \\' , which many people said or had resonances from Beckett \\'s play ` Waiting for Godot \\' and it concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came .So , we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of Beckett , but Gao Xingjian really before 1989 felt , that he was unable to write and to have his plays produced , as he would wish , and so left China couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989 .I think it is a great day for modern Chinese literature and it is a day that has been awaited for the past 60 to 70 years .Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons , France .He spoke to us from his home in Provence .Professor , thank you very much for speaking with us .Not at all .Thank you very much .This is the World , I am Lisa Mullins .There are mounting allegations of police and military brutality in Zimbabwe .But President Robert Mugabe has deployed troops to quell rioting over the rising price of food .There are sharp increases here just as Zimbabwe has slumped into its worst economic crisis since becoming independent in 1980 .In three days of unrest Army helicopters have dropped teargas in poor suburbs of the capital Harare , but many of those protesting say they wo n\\'t stop until Mugabe , the man they blame for the country \\'s economic problems , surrenders the presidency .From Harare the BBC \\'s Grant Ferrett reports .Protestors in one of Harare \\'s poor southern townships run for cover as riot police fire teargas from the top of an armored vehicle .Such confrontations have been taking place all over the south of the capital for several days .The aim is twofold , to demand a halt to the rising prices of basics such as food , fuel and transport , as well as the resignation of President Mugabe .People are demonstrating for the price increase fuel and everything .They are trying to stay away .They do n\\'t want to go to work .They want to stay away .So what happened here , can you tell me ?We set a barricade , not for our people but for the police .We do n\\'t want them .We want them to go .And what have the police done ?They are rounding up people to clear our barricade , forcing them , beating them , throwing teargas canisters into school children , but the war here has just started .Nearly four months after Zimbabwe \\'s bloodiest parliamentary elections , the economy has gone from bad to worse .President Mugabe \\'s vitriolic attacks on the west combined with continuing lawlessness , particularly on white owned commercial farms have driven away donors , investors and tourists .Zimbabwe now has Africa \\'s fastest shrinking economy .Many of us like to characterize Zimbabwe \\'s crisis as an economic crisis but it is wider and deeper than economy .Simba Makoni looks and sounds like an opposition politician .In fact , he is the recently appointed finance minister .You can see the price of bread go up , you can see your bus fares go up , you can see companies closing down or working short weeks and that sort of thing , but you can also read Zimbabwe \\'s crisis in the number of destitute people on the streets , in the number of crimes being committed .245 !245 !Zimbabwe earns the bulk of its hard currency here on the tobacco auction floors .This year \\'s crop is down because of the continuing occupation of white owned farms .When the selling season ends next month , foreign exchange reserves , hardly estimated to cover just a few days of imports , are likely to completely dry up .Without them , paying for central imports such as fuel and electricity will become even more difficult .What we have right now is a political crisis and until that political crisis is resolved , there is no way the economy is going to improve .The sentiments of economist Howard Setoli are widely shared .With eighteen months to go until scheduled presidential elections , Zimbabwe is headed for complete economic ruin .If government continues on its current path , the economy will continue to contract .This year it was expected to contract by 8 % .Next year we see a further contraction of 12 % .So we are talking of massive unemployment , severe foreign exchange shortage .It is an alarming prediction .For those taking part in the protests on the streets , after two decades in office they want President Mugabe to go now .We want a new President .The situation is like Yugoslavia now .We do n\\'t want Mugabe .No more .For The World , I am Grant Ferrett , in Harare .From BBC News in London , I \\'m James Cawling , for The World .Clashes between Israeli Army units and Palestinians have continued into the night .That \\'s after another day of violence in which four Palestinians were killed .Helicopter gunships were deployed around the West Bank village of Bagella .Exchanges of fire between Israelis and Palestinians have also been reported around Jericho , Greg Barrow reports .A day of violence across the West Bank and Gaza has been followed by more clashes after nightfall .Houses in the West Bank village of Bagella have been attached by Israeli helicopter gunships .An Israeli military spokesman said they were deployed in response to gun fire from Palestinians inside Bagella , which was aimed at the Jewish settlement of Kilo .The Israelis say the helicopters went into action firing machine guns , but unconfirmed reports from inside Bagella suggested rockets may have been used .Greg Barrow , BBC News , Jerusalem .This is the World I am Lisa Mullins .Well we ca n\\'t tell you who won Florida , but in a moment we will enter the musical question , who let the dogs out ?First up we have the answer to our geo quiz today .We are looking for a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea .The area is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno , the highest peak of the Apennines .It also includes a lot of sheep , good clean - living , healthy sheep , and an Italian entrepreneur has an idea about how to make a little money of them .The answer is Abruzzo .Journalist Carlos Depalazai was in Rome , Italy and Carlo how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of the Abruzzo ?He is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in the Italy at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food .So this guy came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet .So you can have access through your computer on your desk .Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted .So what does it mean to adopt a sheep , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of its progress on the farm in Italy ?You are not actually adopting the sheep in the sense that you can have it with you .It looks like distant adoption , where you do n\\'t actually have the child in your home .You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .It works in the same way , so you have access on the web site of this little farm , in a little village of Abrutzi and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of money the sheep is actually yours .All right , so the amount of money you have mentioned to us is about 160 US dollars and for that you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling .You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of the sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door .Yeah , I mean this is quite funny , but apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange I think what is really important is that it is a sign of a new concern that is effecting Italian people .I mean we are notoriously lover of good food .We have a generous attitude towards food , and this is a new stuff .The fact that you really care about a sheep in the way she is fed , in the way she is nurtured , in the way people are looking after it , because it \\'s a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on your table up the end .Wait a minute , you said that on your table at the end .Yeah , at the table if it becomes food for instance , which is an option .You are adopting the sheep and whatever happens at the end it \\'s your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing .I mean usually when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving an animal not eventually eating it .I mean this is an option which is available and I think it is a sort of provocation .You know Italians now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like Rome , Florence , Naples .In the past , we were a population of shepherds or farmers .We had completely different attitude towards nature .It seems that we are losing something , and we need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that the Environment Minister in Italy supported the initiative and he himself adopted a sheep is significant .He took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of Italians towards nature and farms .Carlo De Blazia , journalist speaking to us from Rome .Thank you very much Carlo .Nice to talk to you .Thank you .Five years ago today , the agreement ending the war in Bosnia was initialed in Dayton Ohio .Western leaders were n\\'t wild about relying on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to help implement the accord , but they felt they had no choice .Five years later , the West and the United States in particular are n\\'t counting on the deposed leader for anything .They want to see his successor Vojislav Kostinica extradite Milosevic through the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague , but not only is Milosevic still living comfortable in Belgrade , last night he made his first TV appearance in six weeks , giving a pep talk to his supporters .The World \\'s Jeb Sharp reports on the still unresolved fate of Slobodan Milosevic .He \\'s kept Western diplomats spinning in circles for more than a decade .Five years ago they were negotiating with Milosevic at Dayton to stop the war in Bosnia .Two years ago they were still shuttling back and forth to Belgrade in an effort to solve the Kosovo crisis .By March of last year they had given up talking and Nato had started bombing instead .When Milosevic was indited on war crimes charges soon after , US and other Western officials began calling for his arrest and transfer to The Hague , but now that a delicate transition is underway in Serbia , those calls have grown quieter , according to Gary Bass , the author of the new book about war crimes trials , ` Stay , the Hand of Vengeance \\' .Even Madeleine Albright , who is with the President who is usually most decipherous about the importance of prosecuting war criminals , has in fact said that our first priority is making sure that Vojislov Kostunica can consolidate his democratic government and make that transition , and the issue of punishing war criminals sort of takes a back seat .Bass says US diplomats do n\\'t want to risk destabilizing Serbia \\'s fragile political situation by pushing too hard for war crimes trials .After all Bass points out , outside pressure has backfired in the past .In Germany after World War I and in the Ottoman Empire also after World War I , the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials , and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash .A nationalist backlash in Serbia right now could play into Milosevic \\'s hands , especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for next month .That \\'s one reason Western governments are not demanding his immediate arrest , but critics of this approach say letting Milosevic stay in Belgrade could be equally destabilizing .Eva Barnetts , professor of history at Yale , says President Kostunica should cooperate immediately with the Hague Tribunal .This particular UN institution has in its power really to give instant legitimacy to Kostunica but of course at a price .It means that the government of Yugoslavia has to become very serious about dealing with the indited war criminals , beginning with Slobodan Milosevic himself .But even officials at The Hague say they are willing to be patient with the new Yugoslav President .Tribunal spokesman Jim Landel says it helps that Kostunica \\'s people who initially refused to even entertain the idea of arresting Milosevic , may be starting to cooperate with the Tribunal .They have already indicated that they are willing to allow the reopening of the prosecutor \\'s liaison office in Belgrade , and that \\'s certainly a welcome first step .However , it is only a first step .The Tribunal \\'s chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte has applied for a Yugoslav visa and plans to visit Belgrade soon .Delponte \\'s spokeswoman says the prosecutor has much to discuss with Kostunica , not least how to arrest all the indited war crimes suspects now in Serbia .That wo n\\'t be easy .Even in Bosnia where Nato is in charge , troops have failed to capture Bosnian - Serb leader Radavan Karadzic , indited on genocide charges in connection with the 1995 massacre at Shrabanitca .Yale history professor Eva Barnett says the excuses for not arresting Karadzic are not persuasive .The claim is that this would engender tremendously destabilizing consequences that in any event it might be a very , very bloody affair and so on .This does not seem terribly compelling to me .I think that it has to be tried and of course there is always a danger that somebody might get hurt in this , but that is a danger that every attempt at remedying criminal activity has to face .Hague prosecutor Carla Del Ponte is prepared to discuss arrest strategies with Kostunica including the use of foreign troops .It \\'s difficult to know how he would react .Kostunica has questioned the legality of the Hague Tribunal , and talked of trying Milosevic in Yugoslavia .Still , Kostunica \\'s grace period wo n\\'t last forever .When the US Congress approved one hundred million dollars in aid to Serbia last month , it stipulated the aid would stop flowing if Belgrade has n\\'t cooperated with the tribunal by March 31st .For The World , I am Jeb Sharp .This is The World .I am Lisa Mullins .Both George W. Bush and Al Gore today continue to press their cases literally and figuratively .Their PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly .Governor Bush \\'s running mate Dick Cheney talked with reporters about the Republican transition plans , another signal that Bush is getting ready to become the next President of the United States .Meanwhile , Vice President Gore continued his appeal for patience while he contests Bush \\'s claim to victory , and attorneys for both men were preparing for key court battles later in the week , which could settle the three - week dispute over who won Florida and the presidency .The World \\'s Clark Boyd has the latest .All eyes were on Florida yet again today as lawyers , judges , lawmakers and citizens , all picked at the knots that have tied up the conclusion of this presidential election for the past three weeks .Yesterday in Leon County Circuit Court , Judge N. Sander Sauls set a Saturday deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and Palm Beach counties , not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth , to be brought to Tallahassee under police escort .Today , as officials in both two counties ready the ballots for transport , George W. Bush \\'s lawyers asked the judge to order all 1.16 million ballots from the two counties to be trucked to the state capital .Late this afternoon , Judge Sauls granted that motion .In Washington , Vice President Al Gore was back on television this morning trying to shore up public support for his legal cause .In a taped interview , for NBC \\'s Today Show , Gore said despite all the legal maneuvering he is calling on both camps to put partisan politics aside .I think that both Governor Bush and I should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of our partisan supporters .Meanwhile , Bush \\'s vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy man today .After a heart checkup at a Washington hospital he appeared at a news conference to say that he is pressing ahead with transition plans .We have now acquired office space in McClain , Virginia that will become the site for the transition operation that we announced two days ago , so we are just in a business of getting up and running , but we now have an office with a lot of space .We have got people signing up , volunteers coming on , telephones being put in and computers , so we will be fully operational within the next day or two .Earlier today in Florida , the Republican dominated legislature began hearings on calling a special session to pick the state \\'s electors itself , should the December 12th deadline still find the election tied up in the courts .The committee heard from angry voters and precinct workers in Palm Beach .I believe our issues do relate directly to the appointing of electors for the state of Florida .The electors need to be appointed , are supposed to be appointed according to the will of the people and I believe in Palm Beach County that it was very difficult to determine what the will of the people was .Although Al Gore said today that he certainly feels like he won the election , he put his odds of wining the various legal battles at fifty - fifty .Gore said , if Bush does triumph in court , he will throw his support behind the Republican President - elect .But for now , says former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche , both sides are positive that they \\'ve won the election , and says Riche , the longer the fight goes on , the more troublesome the next four years might be .What we risk by prolonging this is greater public cynicism and a hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to work together .After all , come January , these people are going to have to be in Washington whether Gore or Bush is the President .You have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work together with the new President and with each other , so we do n\\'t want to prolong this forever .The US Supreme Court will hear arguments from both sides on Friday and Florida \\'s Leon County Circuit Court will consider the arguments on disputed state ballots on Saturday , and while the nation wearies of the protracted legal battle maybe Leon County Circuit Court judge N. Sander Sauls said it best .The whole process , he said , is a bit like being nibbled to death by a duck .For The World , this is Clark Boyd .Russia \\'s lower house of parliament has overwhelmingly approved restoring the former Soviet anthem as the Russian national anthem .The move had the strong support of Russian President Vladimir Putin who said use of the old anthem represented a gesture of reconciliation .Critics argued that the anthem is a throwback to the former totalitarian government .The anthem will have new words , eliminating verses that praised Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin .The lower house of parliament also gave formal endorsement to Russia \\'s white , red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military .From BBC news in London , I am Gregor Cragey for The World .George W. Bush has met with Al Gore in Washington .The two men met for just 15 minutes at the Vice President \\'s official residence .It \\'s the first time they \\'ve been face to face since the bitterly contested presidential election was finally concluded last week .Bush went into the talks with his defeated rival after meeting with President Clinton earlier today .At a photo opportunity in the Oval Office , Bush thanked the President and fended off an interruption from a veteran White House correspondent .I am humbled and honored , and I ca n\\'t thank the President enough for his hospitality .He did n\\'t need to do this .Yes , he did .I have n\\'t quite finished yet .And I am grateful and I am going to look forward to the discussion .I am here to listen .For his part President Clinton said his only advice to Bush is to assemble a good team and to do what he thinks is right .Bush is now heading back to Texas .The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is due to meet with Egypt \\'s President Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday .The encounter is being seen as an effort by Barak to drum up regional support for a Middle East peace agreement based on President Clinton \\'s proposals .They require Israel to relinquish sovereignty over most of Arab East Jerusalem and the Palestinians to scale back their demand for a return of refugees , but Palestinian chief negotiator Sayeb Erekat says more details are required before both sides can strike a deal .We have so many questions that we have ... so many points that need to be clarified .The most important thing is the clarity .The most important thing is that we focus on the travails of the peace process .Israeli settlers are worried that most of the settlements in the West Bank will be dismantled if an agreement is reached .The spokeswoman for this Settlers \\' Council Yahudi Tayar says this is unacceptable .We have a situation where instead of protecting the interests of the Jewish people , the Israeli Prime Minister is willing to forgo on all of the vital and important areas and not only our history , but the security of the future for the Jewish people in Israel .More than 300 people have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since September .The head of the Palestinian Television and Radio has been shot dead in the Gaza Strip .Masked gunmen opened fire on Hisham Mekki at a hotel in Gaza City but the motive for the attack is unclear .You \\'re listening to BBC News .A Venezuelan Ford executive says Firestone hid information about tyre defects from Ford and should be held responsible for more than one hundred traffic accidents in the South American country .Hector Rodriguez told the hearing of the Venezuelan Consumer Protection Agency that Bridgeton Firestone knew about the tyre defects for many months and should be held responsible for the accidents .In a letter to the consumer panel a spokesman for Firestone said the company \\'s appearance at Wednesday \\'s hearing would have implied fault , which it denies .The Venezuelan government panel wants both Ford and Firestone to compensate victims of accidents caused by Ford vehicles equipped with Firestone tyres .Some 46 people have died on Venezuelan highways in accidents caused by the vehicles .North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has sent his second - in - command to the United States for talks that could see new steps towards ending the Cold War animosity between the two nations .Vice - marshall Jo Myong Rok is to meet President Clinton and other top US officials during a 4 - day visit .He is the highest - ranking North Korean official ever to visit the United States .The United States has lifted some of the economic sanctions it imposed on Yugoslavia two years ago .As VOA \\'s Eve Cornet reports from Belgrade , a US special envoy gave the news to President Vojislav Kostunica .Balkans advisor James O\\'Brien and President Kostunica met for the first top - level talks between the United States and Yugoslavia , since the break of diplomatic relations on the eve of Nato air strikes in 1999 .President Kostunica said he was ready for dialogue with the West , but stressed that territorial accords reached with international negotiators in the Balkans should be respected .Balkans envoy O\\'Brian stressed that the US would begin lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia and that only technical issues remain an obstacle to reestablishing relations .However , key sanctions which directly target ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and his allies remain in place .Meanwhile , parties in Slobodan Milosevic \\'s socialist coalition are making it clear they plan to hold onto control of the Serbian government , despite calls for new elections .Eve Cornet , VOA News , Belgrade .A leading expert on international finance , Johns Hopkins University economist , Steve Hanky says Yugoslavia \\'s new President Vojislav Kostunica only has a few weeks to reassure financial stability in the dominant republic of Serbia by stabilizing the inflation - prone Yugoslav dinar .VOA \\'s Barry Wood spoke with Mr. Hanky , who recently returned from several weeks in Europe .Mr. Hanky says that President Kostunica has only two options for achieving financial stability in Serbia .He can either abandon the dinar and adopt the German mark as the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro has done or , Mr. Hanky says , Serbia can adopt a currency board system under which a new currency would be issued under conditions of utmost financial discipline .I think if Kostunica does not move in a direction decisively within the next month of abandoning the dinar completely or going to a deutsche mark based currency board where we have a foreign governor on the board , the chances for economic unification in the area and economic recovery in Serbia are slim at best .Mr. Hanky says it \\'s essential that President Kostunica embrace the principle of sound money , something Mr. Hanky believes is as important as the rule of law .Last week , the new acting head of the Yugoslav Central Bank devalued the dinar , bringing it to 30 to the dollar , compared to the previous official rate of 20 .Mr. Hanky , who regards the dinar as the world \\'s worst currency , says the deutsch mark is becoming the de facto money in the entire Balkan region .If they use the d mark in Serbia , obviously there would be essentially the same system that they have in Montenegro and if they had a currency board with a foreign national running the thing , like Bosnia , it would essentially mean that they had a unified system was what they have in Montenegro because with Montenegro , they would still have the d mark as legal tender , but they would also use this new currency board money from Serbia and there would be absolutely no problem , and furthermore , from a regional point of view , you \\'d have essentially most of the Balkans in a unified currency zone because Bulgaria has a currency board that \\'s d mark based .Bosnia has a currency board that \\'s d mark based .Kosovo has a d mark , Montenegro has a d mark .Mr. Hanky was instrumental in developing the deutsche mark based currency systems throughout the region .Advisors to Mr. Kostunica say they are considering a currency board system for Serbia .Barry Wood , VOA News , Washington .A Russian diver has found the bodies of three of the 118 sailors who were killed when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the Barents Sea .The diver entered the sub after a Russian and Norwegian recovery team cut a hole wide enough for him to enter a rear compartment .The drilling and cutting effort took several days .Navy officials do not expect that all 118 bodies can be recovered .The Balkan Stability Pact has admitted Yugoslavia as a full member marking Belgrade \\'s return to the international community after years of isolation under ousted President Slobodan Milosevic .The head of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe Bodo Hombak announced the decision as representatives of member countries met in the Romanian capital Bucharest .A special envoy of Yugoslavia \\'s new President Vojislav Kostunica reaffirmed his country \\'s commitment to peace in the region .The Balkan Stability Pact was established last year in response to the Kosovo crisis .Here in the United States , it \\'s just a week and a day before Americans go to the polls to fill offices from local school boards to Congress and the President .In the latest daily CNN USA Today Gallup popular opinion survey , George W Bush , the Governor of Texas , the Republican nominee , holds a 49 % to 42 % advantage over his Democratic opponent Al Gore , the Vice President , but two other major surveys gave Mr. Bush only a one - point lead .On Sunday , several major newspapers weighed in with their endorsements and VOA \\'s Peter Hymline has that story .In its Sunday editions , the New York Times calls Vice President Gore , the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government , his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision making and his devotion to the general welfare .The Times editorial says Mr. Gore has , in its words , struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration \\'s ethical lapses .The paper \\'s editorial board goes on to say , we believe Mr. Gore would never follow Bill Clinton \\'s example of reckless conduct that cheapens the Presidency .The Times also praise Republican candidate George W Bush for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but the writers said they had concluded Mr. Bush \\'s agenda was harsh on issues such as women \\'s rights , guns , and law enforcement .The Times joins the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave its backing to Mr. Gore .Other major dailies throwing their support to the Vice President Sunday included The Philadelphia Inquirer , The Denver Post and The San Jose California Mercury News .Mr. Bush also picked up some key endorsements Sunday including both major Chicago papers .In its editorial , The Chicago Tribune called Mr. Gore a decent man but concluded that , in its words , his penchant for enhancement has become something of a running joke .The Tribune endorsement says this is an election about honesty , about restoring bipartisanship , about fostering government that will nurture a booming economy without getting in the way of American ingenuity .The paper concludes that there is one candidate who will do that and that is George W Bush .The battle of the editorials reflects what many political analysts predict will be one of the closest Presidential races in decades .Most opinion polls give Mr. Bush a slight lead but a just released survey by Newsweek magazine puts the text .The Newsweek poll indicates voters consider Vice President Gore the more intelligent candidate , but they see Governor Bush as more honest .Peter Hymline , VOA News , Washington .Meanwhile , in Philadelphia the Phillies have hired Larry Bowa as their new manager for the 2001 season .The fiery Bowa helped lead the Phillies to the franchise \\'s only World Series Championship in 1980 , as a player .The 54 -

D. Ye , \" then I take a look at my family \\'s situation and it seems as though I have n\\'t really done anything at all . \"As chairman of the board at Dongguan Primax Electronics Products , Ye has nine factories and over 4,000 employees under him .Why would someone so successful be so down about his situation ?Says Ye with a worried frown , \" Recently my wife has been calling me a lot from Canada to talk about her problems trying to maintain discipline with our kids .They \\'re getting out of control , and we \\'re afraid they might get into trouble .They say it \\'s tough to try and raise children as an expatriate , and I can sure attest to that . \"I \\'m doing this for youYe has worked hard for many years for the Taiwanese community in Dongguan , a subject he cares deeply about .\" I do n\\'t care if it \\'s nothing more than a thatched - roof cottage ; I want to get a school for Taiwanese children up and running . \"After stepping down from his former position as chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen Association of Dongguan -LRB- TBAD -RRB- , Ye took over as director of the Dongguan Taiwanese School Preparatory Committee .Says Ye , \" I \\'m even busier now than I was before . \"Of the more than 3,000 Taiwanese business people in Dongguan , less than 5 % have been joined by their families .With the extended absence of these people from Taiwan , undisciplined children and lonely spouses \" cause a lot of problems for families and society as a whole , \" says Ye .There are a number of reasons why family members are unwilling to move to the mainland -some spouses have jobs in Taiwan , crime is a concern on the mainland , and the quality of medical care is not so good there .For people with families , however , the key stumbling block is the quality of education .Asks Sylvia Yang , deputy chairperson of the TBAD Women \\'s Division , \" What are we working to achieve , anyway ?We want a better life for our children , of course . \"She adds that while the education system on the mainland is not so bad , Taiwanese people have a hard time getting used to the way of life there .\" How would you feel if your child learned from his classmates to cough up phlegm all over the place ?Sorry , but that \\'s not something you can get used to . \"Grumbles one businessman , \" My kids have come home singing the national anthem of the PRC , and calling Chiang Kai - shek a thug and Lee Teng - hui a public enemy .Now how do I handle something like that ? \"In the opinion of Norman Hsu , vice president of a foods company whose family of four had spent a few years in New Zealand before moving to Dongguan , \" The first thing to do is ask the children their reason for saying such things .Ask what their teachers say , and what they themselves think .Then go on to give them your own views . \"While many consider Hsu \\'s approach a very enlightened one , there is no denying that at the gut level the influence of mainland Chinese culture rubs the wrong way .Comments one Taiwanese businessman , \" You worry that your kid is going to become a communist . \"Taiwanese people in the mainland invariably wish to maintain their ties with Taiwan , and are particularly anxious to ensure that their children can integrate quickly into the school system back home once they return .With the number of Taiwanese in Dongguan increasing in recent years , it was just a matter of time before a Taiwanese school was established .Thanks to the vigorous advocacy of H. D. Ye , the TBAD began working seriously in 1994 to establish a school , but the difficulties were considerable .They had to find land , funds , teachers , and much more .With Taiwanese and mainland authorities at political loggerheads , the school \\'s promoters had to jump through hoops every step of the way in seeking to hire teachers from Taiwan , use Taiwanese teaching materials , and appoint a Taiwanese person to the post of principal .They also had to obtain the cooperation of the authorities in Taiwan .Since the people in Dongguan were paying taxes in Taiwan and planning to run the school according to the Taiwanese system , they asked whether the Ministry of Education might not treat the school the same as any private school in Taiwan , and subsidize it accordingly .Teacher seniority was also a major issue in the effort to get the school established ; if teachers from public schools were to teach in Dongguan , would they retain the seniority that they had built up in Taiwan ?\" If we had n\\'t been able to hire experienced teachers , \" notes Ye , \" it would have seriously impaired the quality of our faculty . \"Ye continually stressed to authorities in both Taiwan and the mainland , \" Politics is for the politicians .In the meantime , our children need an education .That \\'s all we \\'re asking . \"The main obstacles were finally overcome by the end of 1999 .The mainland Chinese authorities have agreed to allow the use of Taiwanese teaching materials and faculty .As for the appointment of a principal , TBAD vice chairman Andrew Yeh states , \" I think the mainland authorities will handle the situation flexibly .They \\'ll probably let us hire who we want as long as we agree to refer to the person as a director or something like that . \"The Dongguan city government has leased an 86,000 - square - meter site to the association at an extremely low price , and the school \\'s cornerstone was laid last year in a ceremony held on 3 November .The school will begin admitting students this coming September and start classes in October .The school will accept elementary and junior high school students at first .The decision about whether to open senior high school classes will be made later depending on demand .Where to send the kids ?H. D. Ye notes that there are now about 400 children of Taiwanese expatriates in Dongguan who attend school in the mainland .Greater than half attend mainland China \\'s regular elementary and secondary schools , while the more affluent Taiwanese send their children to private schools for expatriate children .Chang Mei - liang , chairperson of the TBAD Women \\'s Division , is among the latter group .After her elder son and daughter finished elementary school in Taiwan she sent them to a boarding school in Britain .Her ten - year - old child is too young for that though , so she sends him to a school in Shenzhen for the children of Hong Kong expats .The child only comes home once a week , and sending him to the school in Shenzhen costs several hundred thousand NT dollars per year .The Hong Kong elementary school and the international school are both an hour or two away from Dongguan , and many of the Taiwanese in Dongguan want to be able to see their children every day .This prompted a group of them to establish a private bilingual school called Little Oxford in February 1998 .The school admits children from kindergarten -LRB- age five -RRB- through grade five of elementary school .Some of Little Oxford \\'s 200 students -LRB- such as Norman Hsu \\'s child -RRB- used to go to school in Shenzhen , while others have transferred in from the mainland Chinese public school system .Little Oxford is very similar to the Taiwanese school being promoted by the TBAD .Most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in Taiwan \\'s elementary schools , and of the 15 or so teachers there , three are from Taiwan .The big difference is that classes are taught in both Chinese and English because the Taiwanese parents are very interested in seeing that their children learn English well .According to Huang Su , executive director of Little Oxford , \" A lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children \\'s education is exactly like the regular system in Taiwan , but I have to remind them that once you \\'ve left in Taiwan , you \\'re not regular any longer . \"According to Huang , making the school a mirror image of those in Taiwan does not necessarily mean that you are running a good school .The key is to provide an education that meets the needs of the students .In addition to Taiwanese teaching materials , she has also incorporated some materials from the mainland and overseas into the curriculum .Huang Su , who hails from Beijing , majored in English at university and is keenly interested in education .She came to Dongguan after marrying a Taiwanese expat there , and it was the Taiwanese business community that asked her to run a school .Little Oxford now has a very good reputation in the Taiwanese community .In fact , some Taiwanese send their children to Little Oxford from as far away as Zhuhai -LRB- just opposite Macau on the other side of the Pearl River estuary -RRB- .Huang has been deeply impressed by the deep concern that Taiwanese parents show for their children \\'s education in the face of difficulties posed by living away from their native Taiwan .One parent , for example , practically begged her to admit his six - year old child , explaining , \" He \\'s never had any playmates .The only people he \\'s ever been with are his nanny and some employees from the plant . \"The Taiwanese kids at Little Oxford come from many different backgrounds .Some speak in a mixture of Chinese and English , while others speak and look just like any mainland Chinese child .Many of them have transferred in and out of lots of different schools in the United States , Taiwan , and the mainland .There is no trace of the world \\'s cares on their faces though ; the thing they \\'re most concerned about is studying a little less and playing a little more .One bespectacled child laments , \" School is better in Canada because they do n\\'t have to do so much homework .There \\'s too much homework in Taiwan and the mainland .It \\'s no fun . \"An older brother and sister , it turns out , have both lived overseas .Huang stays in close touch with the Taiwanese parents .Their children enjoy very comfortable homes and seem to have experienced much of the world , but the biggest problem is that \" they are n\\'t motivated and do n\\'t understand why they should need to study . \"Another problem for the school is the lack of interesting things to do in Dongguan .Unless teachers are very devoted to education , they are not likely to stay there long .\" It \\'s all the more difficult , \" notes Huang frankly , \" to hold on to teachers from Taiwan , who ca n\\'t help but compare their situation here with what they are accustomed to in Taiwan . \"The Taiwanese school will be faced with the same high turnover rate that has dogged Little Oxford .Dongguan , cradle of scholarsWith Little Oxford already in operation , why should the Taiwanese expats wish to establish a separate school for their children ?Sylvia Yang points out that Little Oxford is a private school with limited space and teaching staff , and even without the boarding expenses charged in Shenzhen , the tuition at Little Oxford still costs RMB 38,000 -LRB- NT$ 160,000 -RRB- per semester , more than many Taiwanese parents can pay .Says H. D. Ye , \" We would like to get funding from both the Taiwan and mainland authorities to hold tuition down . \"Although the cornerstone has already been laid , Ye reports that not enough funds have been raised , nor have all the teachers been hired .Although the picture generally looks pretty good , there is still much work to be done .Expenses for the first few years are expected to reach NT$ 60 million , and only about NT$ 20 million has been raised so far .Ye often speaks in Taiwan on the topic of investing in the mainland , something which he knows a lot about .Says Ye jokingly , \" I jack up my speaking fees to make extra money for the school . \"The TBAD is now considering funding the school through an endowment , shares in which would be sold to business firms .The location for the school has already been selected .It is a large site in the township of Zhongtang .The lot is basically empty right now , but the roar of excavators fills the air , and the steel piles have already been driven .The school grounds are located next to the ancient Beidi Temple , which is shaded by the leaves of a spreading banyan tree .On the temple gate a fading couplet reads : \" He who is truly dedicated to his endeavor will become a great master , and shall make of his surroundings a land of delight .He who has achieved true wisdom shall make of his home a cynosure for great talent , no matter where he may be . \"The locals must have taken this message to heart over the years , because it is said that hometown scholars from Zhongtang often took the top spot in the imperial examinations of centuries past .It is very gratifying that a place like Dongguan , with its abundant business opportunities , should also have a scenic spot so rich in scholarly tradition .It is also exciting to look forward to the founding of a school for the Taiwanese business community .Apart from making money , will the expatriates here create a \" Taiwanese miracle \" on the cultural front as well ?p. 91Little Oxford , a bilingual elementary school attended primarily by the children of Taiwanese expatriates , guards its entranceway closely .A school bus takes students to and from school , and all visitors must announce themselves before entering .p. 92Little Oxford elementary school teaches classes in both Chinese and English , which is just what the Taiwanese expatriates want for their children .p. 93H. D. Ye is a key player in Dongguan \\'s Taiwanese expatriate community .He has played the lead role in establishing a Taiwanese school in Dongguan .The community \\'s ability to wrap up preparations and start construction in just two years is due in large part to Ye \\'s energy and enthusiasm .Taiwan News Holds Seminar on Cross-Strait RelationsThe biggest story of the year in Taiwan has naturally been the changing of the guard at the presidential palace as a result of the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- victory in the election on 18 March .Jin Zhong , president and editor - in - chief of Hong Kong \\'s OPEN magazine , which specializes in political reporting and commentary , spent an entire week in Taiwan observing the election campaign and its aftermath , and on 20 March , OPEN organized a seminar titled \" The New President and Cross-Strait Relations . \"The seminar was held in cooperation with Taiwan News , one of the island \\'s oldest English - language newspapers -LRB- known until last year as the China News -RRB- .The KMT ticket finished nearly 14 percentage points behind independent candidate James Soong and pulled in fully two million votes fewer than the DPP ticket , a margin of defeat which Jin Zhong described in his opening remarks as stunning .When Chinese Communist premier Zhu Rongji made belligerent remarks a few days before the election in an effort to scare voters away from the DPP ticket , the ruling party made a grievous mistake , opined Jin , when it failed to come out strongly critical of Zhu and attempted instead to capitalize on the incident by playing the \" fear card . \"At the same time , however , winning candidate Chen Shui - bian captured only 39 % of the vote , which translates to a weak mandate .As a result , he must take a moderate line that stresses inter-party cooperation .He will have to include a wide range of people in his government , keep a low profile , guard against any temptation to grow imperious in power , and strive to be a president of all the people .As for mainland China \\'s saber - rattling , Jin argued that there is no need for undue concern .Stated Jin , \" The consequences would be too severe .It \\'s not like Taiwan is without any means of retaliation .Are the mainland authorities really prepared to see Hong Kong and Shanghai go up in flames ? \"There are other perspectives on cross-strait relations , of course .The seminar participants basically fell into three camps on future prospects .Some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy .Perhaps the most optimistic view was expressed by Ruan Ming , a visiting professor at Tamkang University \\'s Department of China Studies who in the 1980s was an assistant to former Chinese Communist Secretary General Hu Yaobang .Ruan stated that Beijing \\'s basic position on Taiwan has not changed at all since the days of Deng Xiaoping .\" There \\'s nothing new in what they \\'re saying . \"The only thing the Chinese Communists are saying , says Ruan , is that they will attack \" if Taiwan makes any sort of formal move toward independence , \" and Taiwan has no need to formalize anything because changing the country \\'s name would be meaningless .\" No matter what you call yourself , people are still going to call you Taiwan .It \\'s just like in England - the official name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , but nobody calls it that .And there \\'s no need to going around shouting , \\' We \\'re a country ! We \\'re a country ! \\'Who in the international community does that ? \"Pragmatism , please\" Taiwan needs to be more pragmatic , \" says Ruan , \" just like the mainland . \"They made a lot of noise ahead of the election trying to sway votes , but once the election was over they backpedaled quickly with the simple statement , \" We \\'ll wait and see what they say and do . \"The attitude with them , in Ruan \\'s view , is very pragmatic .Ruan is optimistic about cross-strait relations under the new regime , and states , \" Chen Shui - bian is best positioned to improve cross-strait relations . \"He likens Chen to the staunchly anti-communist Richard Nixon , who was able to normalize ties with the Chinese Communists precisely because he was trusted by the American people .Similarly , when Chen Shui - bian negotiates with Beijing , no one will worry about him selling Taiwan down the river .The noted political commentator Chin Heng - wei , chief editor of Taiwan \\'s Contemporary Monthly , agreed strongly with Ruan \\'s comments , and added , \" In this election the people of Taiwan were even more concerned about domestic issues than they were about cross-strait relations . \"The most pressing issues facing the new president are education , the environment , \" black gold \" politics -LRB- murky connections between the worlds of politics , business , and organized crime -RRB- , and crime fighting .When Nobel laureate Lee Yuan - tseh came out in support of Chen Shui - bian , implying that the DPP represented \" the progressive forces in society , \" Chen \\'s support jumped immediately upward .Virtually everyone at the seminar was in agreement that it is neither advisable nor necessary to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue , and that Taiwan need only avoid stirring up Chinese nationalism .Wei Chengsi -LRB- news director at ATV news in Hong Kong and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in Shanghai -RRB- emphasized the fluid nature of Beijing \\'s policy on Taiwan .He feels that the mainland authorities face many more pressing issues than Taiwan , and that the current tension basically stems from President Lee Teng - hui \\'s pronouncement on state - to - state relations .Having been through the Tiananmen massacre , Wei felt compelled to warn the people of Taiwan , \" You absolutely must not think the way the students did in Beijing in \\'89 .You must not think that \\' the communists wo n\\'t attack because the US wo n\\'t let them , \\' and then go out of your way to provoke them to where they no longer have an out .Under the wrong circumstances , failure to display strong Chinese nationalism could spell political suicide for a Communist Party leader , and he might well decide , \\' To hell with the US and economic development , I \\'ve got to attack if I \\'m to stay in power . \\'That would be an incredible disaster . \"Chiu Hsiang - chung , chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal , also advocated cautious optimism .In his view , there has been no fundamental change in the cross-strait relationship , but he listed a few variables that bear close watching .The first is the combination of nationalism and Jiang Zemin \\'s desire to serve another term as Secretary General of the Communist Party and make his mark on history .Could he attempt to use nationalism to further his ambition ?Second , the People \\'s Liberation Army hopes to parlay the Taiwan issue into increased influence in domestic politics .Third , Taiwan could make mistakes and give the Chinese Communists an excuse for military action .And a fourth factor is the wishy - washy American support for Taiwan .If all of these variables combined in the wrong way , the military authorities could make a miscalculation that would lead to war .When hawk meets hawkChou Chi - ping -LRB- senior advisor at Business Weekly -RRB- and Tseng Fu - sheng -LRB- general secretary of the KMT \\'s Department of Mainland Operations -RRB- felt that the future of cross-strait relations is still up in the air .Chou , as a former official with the Straits Exchange Foundation , has had direct dealings with the Chinese Communists .He argued that the DPP \\'s view of the mainland has always been colored by ideology , and thus take a dim view of the other side .It is true , acknowledges Chou , that Chen Shui - bian has changed his basic stance and now says that he \" will not change the country \\'s name , declare independence , or seek to enshrine the state - to - state principle in the constitution . \"It is also true that Lee Yuan - tseh -LRB- who is highly respected in the mainland for his academic achievements -RRB- has vouched for the sensibility of Chen \\'s approach to cross-strait relations .And yes , once again , it is true that the Chinese Communists have muted their rhetoric considerably .Nevertheless , the two sides view each other with suspicion .If the Chinese Communists conclude that Taiwan \\'s leadership has dropped its insistence on formal independence only to pursue a policy that includes de facto independence as its aim , Chou argued that this will introduce a note of uncertainty into the relationship .Tseng Fu - sheng feels that Taiwan should claim the high ground by holding up its experience in democratization as an example for the Chinese Communists .Says Tseng , \" Reunification depends entirely on whether China can democratize . \"His biggest worry is that the deep gulf between the DPP and the mainland authorities could cause them to misread each other .He stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between Beijing , Washington , and Taipei .If the hawks gained the upper hand at the same time in all three capitals , opined Tseng , the result could be war .The seminar attendants also examined Taiwan \\'s domestic situation .Versatile author and cultural commentator Ping Lu offered some very incisive comments regarding the post-election protests outside the KMT headquarters .In demanding that Lee Teng - hui resign as chairman of the KMT to take responsibility for the election defeat , Ping -LRB- herself a second - generation \" mainlander \" -RRB- argued that the protest revealed an ethnic fault line in Taiwanese society .It was a venting of mass frustration on the part of one particular ethnic group , said Ping , noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders .This group feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of KMT rule they have always thought of themselves as a privileged \" majority \" in Taiwan even though in fact they are a minority .They do not identify with Taiwan as their home , and they have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority .In some ways the election has forced them to realize that they truly are a minority .This development should help to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in Taiwan .The participants generally felt that the election was a victory for democracy .On the domestic front , the victory of Chen Shui - bian showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort to banish \" black gold \" from the political arena .In cross-strait relations Chen \\'s victory spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted within the framework of a civil war between he KMT and the Chinese Communist Party .Reform of the KMT and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in Taiwan .It appears that the people of Taiwan have finally taken their first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect .President Chen Travels Abroad-LRB- Chang Chiung - fang / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-President Chen Shui - bian visited the Nicaraguan National Assembly on August 17 , where he received a medal from the president of the assembly , Ivan Escobar Fornos .-LRB- photo by Wu Chi - chang , Central News Agency -RRB-On August 25 President Chen Shui - bian wrapped up his first overseas trip since taking office , swinging through three countries in Latin America and another three in Africa .While in the Dominican Republic to attend the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia , Chen had a chance to meet with the leaders of many different nations .The president signed joint communiques with Nicaragua , Gambia , and Chad , and agreed to provide US$ 4.6 million worth of loans to the Dominican Republic to serve as a guarantee to help the latter secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund .\" We can not use pressure from Beijing as an excuse for our diplomatic setbacks , \" said Chen , who used concrete actions to demonstrate to ROC \\'s allies that our country has no intention of pulling back from its diplomatic partnerships ; on the contrary , the ROC will be working even harder than before .Chen Shui - bian left on August 13 for a 13 - day trip that included state visits to the Latin American nations of the Dominican Republic , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , as well as the west African nations of Gambia , Burkina Faso , and Chad .Before boarding the plane on the 13th , Chen Shui - bian delivered a short speech in which he stated , \" Taiwan must stand up and be counted . \"The purpose of this trip , said Chen , is to share Taiwan \\'s experiences with other countries , and he also indicated the hope that this trip would help to solidify Taiwan \\'s diplomatic relations .The entourage was the largest ever to accompany an ROC president abroad , and included : Chuang Ming - yao -LRB- secretary - general , National Security Council -RRB- , Tien Hung - mao -LRB- minister of foreign affairs -RRB- , Lin Hsin - yi -LRB- minister of economic affairs -RRB- , Chen Po - chih -LRB- chairman , Council of Economic Planning and Development -RRB- , Chen Hsi - huang -LRB- chairman , Council of Agriculture -RRB- , Chung Chin -LRB- head of the Government Information Office -RRB- , Jeffrey Koo -LRB- chairman of the National Association of Industry and Commerce -RRB- , Wang Yu - tseng -LRB- chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of the ROC -RRB- , and Lin Kun - chung -LRB- chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries -RRB- .There were also many legislators in the delegation , including Hung Chi - chang , Helen Chu , Feng Ting - kuo , and Li Yin - yun .-LRB- Li is soon to assume a position as deputy director of the ROC diplomatic post in Washington , DC . -RRB-The total size of the delegation came to nearly 200 people , including more than 50 journalists .The president kept to a very tight schedule during the trip .After a brief stopover in Los Angeles on the 13th , Chen continued on and reached the Dominican Republic on the 14th .He attended the presidential inauguration there on the 16th , and was able to meet with the leaders and representatives of friendly nations from around the world .On the 17th he continued on to Nicaragua , where he met with President Arnoldo Aleman and delivered a speech to the Nicaraguan National Assembly .On the 18th , presidents Chen and Aleman signed a joint communique before Chen Shui - bian departed for Costa Rica , where he received the Great Cross of Juan Mora Fernandez , a gold medal which is the nation \\'s highest award .On the 20th he flew across the Atlantic Ocean to Gambia to meet with Gambian President Yahya Jameh before heading on to Burkina Faso and a dinner with President Blaise Compaore .On the 23rd Chen delivered a speech to the Gambian parliament .The next stop on the itinerary was Chad , where Chen dined with Chad \\'s President Idris Debi .On the 25th Chen and Debi signed a joint communique and held a press conference before heading back to Taiwan slightly ahead of schedule to oversee efforts to deal with the powerful Typhoon Bilis .Chen \\'s stopover in Los Angeles was a sensitive subject , for Chen had originally planned an informal meeting with several members of the US Congress .After furious protests from Beijing and discouragement from the US State Department , however , Chen canceled the plan just the day before arriving in Los Angeles .A crowd of 500 to 600 Taiwanese living in the United States showed up to greet the president at his hotel and protest against the US government \\'s \" caving in to Beijing at the expense of Taiwan . \"When Chen arrived on the 14th in the Dominican Republic , he was greeted at the airport by over 100 representatives of the Taiwanese business community there , and more than 700 Taiwanese residents threw a party for the president that night at his hotel .The next day , Chen took advantage of the upcoming presidential inauguration to meet with leaders from a number of countries with which the ROC has diplomatic relations , including the vice-president of El Salvador and the second vice president of Panama .On the 16th Chen attended the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia .The ROC contingent was larger than any other at the ceremony .The ROC currently has diplomatic relations with 29 countries , half of which are located in Latin America and the Caribbean .In recent years , however , mainland China has continually upgraded its trade links with the ROC \\'s diplomatic partners .The allegiance of a number of these countries may be put to the test in the coming years by various political and economic considerations .In the case of the Dominican Republic , for example , supporters of President Mejia announced to the media on the eve of President Chen \\'s arrival that mainland China was planning to build a large thermal power plant in their country .In addition , the Dominican Republic is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council in 2002 , and will certainly be lobbying for Beijing \\'s support .This situation could affect relations with Taiwan .On the bright side , Taiwan has scored a few points of its own in this diplomatic tug of war .When Chen arrived in Costa Rica on the 18th , his hosts departed from the pattern of the past few years by promising to support the ROC s bid for membership in the United Nations .Costa Rica \\'s President Miguel Rodriguez also accompanied President Chen on a tour of a Taiwanese export processing zone , an orchid farm run by Taiwan Sugar Corporation , and a vocational training school .President Chen departed on the 20th for Africa , where the ROC has eight diplomatic partners .Chen Shui - bian is the first ROC president ever to travel to western Africa .There is little two - way trade between Taiwan and any of the three countries on Chen \\'s African itinerary .Instead , agricultural and economic assistance constitute the mainstays of our diplomatic ties with these countries .Taiwanese agricultural specialists stationed in Burkina Faso have converted 1,000 hectares of desert to arable land , while Taiwanese specialists sent to Gambia have successfully transplanted tomatoes , green beans , okra , and various leafy vegetables from Taiwan and raised them on Gambian soil .In addition to this type of technical assistance , Taiwan has also assisted with various infrastructure projects .Taiwan \\'s most notable contribution to Gambia \\'s infrastructure is the main terminal at the airport .Gambian President Yahya Jameh declared his support for admission of the ROC to the United Nations , and as a gesture of goodwill declared that all holders of ROC passports would henceforth automatically be granted 90 - day landing visas upon arrival in Gambia .President Chen \\'s trip yielded many positive results and generated a lot of very favorable media coverage , but it was not problem - free .First , as the president was preparing to depart Taiwan , the Nicaraguan foreign minister publicly called upon the ROC to make good on the previous administration \\'s promise of US$ 100 million in assistance .This remark sparked controversy in Taiwan , where some accused the new government of pursuing the same \" checkbook diplomacy \" practiced by its predecessor .Chen Shui - bian responded that while the new administration has not made plans for any new promises of foreign aid , neither will it fail to honor the promises made by its predecessor .Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao stated that the purpose of Chen \\'s trip was to consolidate Taiwan \\'s diplomatic ties , and to strengthen friendships by building upon the existing foundation .Tien stressed that the president would not sign any new foreign aid agreements .President Chen received a very warm welcome in Nicaragua , but the local press still mentioned \" checkbook diplomacy \" in reporting on the visit .The ROC \\'s ambassador to Nicaragua , Antonio Tsai , bluntly argued in a briefing with Chen that Taiwan \\'s foreign assistance to Nicaragua was being misused .According to Tsai , the assistance has been used to build a presidential palace and a new headquarters for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .Opposition politicians charge that the aid has done nothing for everyday people , and Western nations have also been critical .A second problem connected with the trip was the question of who would act in the president \\'s stead while he was out of the country .Concern over this issue prompted President Chen to state before his departure that he would remain commander - in - chief of the military forces , and that he would maintain hot lines to every cabinet - level agency .The president said that there was no need for an acting president because he had taken painstaking precautions to ensure domestic political stability during his absence .So is Taiwan \\'s diplomacy a way of giving back to the international community ?Or is it checkbook diplomacy ?Ambassador - without - portfolio Lu Yi - cheng wrote an article in which he argued that foreign aid has always been universally recognized as a regular tool of diplomacy as well as a humanitarian necessity , and there is no reason why Taiwan should have to steer clear of it .He pointed out that the world \\'s developed nations spend an average of 0.24 % of GNP on foreign aid , as opposed to 0.17 % in Taiwan \\'s case .In view of Taiwan \\'s economic strength , argued Lu , our foreign aid expenditures need not be reduced ; in fact , they should even be raised somewhat .The ROC has been criticized a lot in recent years for pursuing checkbook diplomacy , so there was no surprise when this issue cropped up in connection with the president \\'s trip .The question of an acting president , however , has never before been a matter of concern .This situation is to some degree a reflection of the fact that the public still has doubts about the new administration \\'s ability to govern .This is an important point that is worth keeping in mind .Paralympics Offer Stage for Taiwan PerformersClosing ceremonies for the 2000 Sydney Paralympics were held on October 29 .Nearly 4000 athletes from more than one hundred and twenty countries participated .This event , a manifestation of the ideal that \" the flame burns in the body , mind , and spirit of every individual , \" broke down international barriers and was an admirable example of the global village in operation .The ROC team took one gold , two silvers , and four bronzes , marking the first time any Taiwan athlete has returned from an Olympic games with a gold .Also , as part of the events , Taiwan \\'s Crescent Moon Dance Troupe , made up of handicapped persons , was the only foreign troupe invited by the Australian government to participate in the Paralympic Arts Festival .But even more important than these honors was the spirit of overcoming all obstacles and facing life with courage that shone through during the Paralympics .The just - completed Paralympics were enriched by ethnic flavorings .The opening ceremony on October 18 was in the form of a welcoming for aboriginal elders .Amidst a festive atmosphere , the athletes entered the stadium by categories - one group in wheelchairs , another on crutches , another led by guide dogs .The events at the 12 - day Paralympics were packed with spectators .The 1.1 million tickets sold show the extent to which everyone took the games seriously .The host government even set up a huge TV screen in Darwin , which is the port of entry for the most visitors to Australia , to broadcast the games live .The games were also a platform for the idea of the welfare state caring for disadvantaged groups , and for emphasizing how handicapped persons can break through barriers and limitations .On October 14 , Taiwan \\'s Crescent Moon Dance Company created a sensation with their performance \" Standing on the Highest Peak , \" performed in traditional vests and short skirts as worn by indigenous people in Taiwan .After the 10 - minute performance ended , the hall was rocked by thunderous applause .The standing ovation lasted three minutes , and some people were even moved to tears .The Crescent Moon Dance Company has only been in operation for four years .Organized by a group of amputee women on a nonprofessional basis , it is the world \\'s first dance troupe of its kind .As its manifesto reads : \" One with no voice may nonetheless sing .One with no wings may nonetheless soar .One with no limbs may nonetheless dance .The crescent moon and the full moon are the moon just the same , and equally beautiful . \"The troupe also delighted Sydney citizens with a performance at the Sydney City Hall on October 19 .In the competition , host country Australia took the most medals , including 64 golds.Among the ROC \\'s medals , the gold - the first ever for Taiwan - was won by Chiang Chih - chung .With a throw of 57.28 meters , Chiang shattered the world record for the javelin in the F12 visually - impaired class .Chiang , a member of the Bunun indigenous people , received a traditional hero \\'s welcome home from the Bunun of Sanmin Rural Township in Kaohsiung County .During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised Chiang for his glorious deeds .Meanwhile , the ROC table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time .In the wheelchair men \\'s doubles class 5 event , Chou Chang - sheng and Lin Yen - hung took the silver , while Chou won another silver in the men \\'s singles .The men \\'s class 9 team for persons with non-leg - related disabilities and the women \\'s wheelchair team of combined classes 4 and 5 took bronzes in team events , while Li Ching - chung -LRB- men \\'s judo class 1 -RRB- and Lu Li - hua -LRB- women \\'s powerlifting class 1 -RRB- garnered individual bronzes .Among Asian countries , South Korea turned in the best performance , taking five gold medals .This was due in part to the fact that the ROK government has provided special coaching in wheelchair table tennis to soldiers injured in service .Indeed , many handicapped competitors from other nations besides the ROK were retired veterans .Their pensions allow them free time to train , and through athletics they bring meaning to their lives and glory to their countries .Taiwan team members , on the other hand , come from a variety of backgrounds , and train out of personal interest .They must give up working if they wish to train full - time .The South Korean team of veterans , by overcoming their injuries to give a display of athleticism at the international level , have emerged from the shadow of war and transformed their handicaps into glorious results .This example should provide food for thought to the disabled and sports communities in the future .Pali : Storied Past , Uncertain Future-LRB- Lin I - hsien / photos by Diago Chiu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-I wonder if Pali is jealous of Tanshui .I ask because fate has treated these two towns , separated only by the mouth of the Tanshui River , very differently .Tanshui is celebrated in poems , songs , paintings , and lovers \\' memories of its scenic views .Pali has donuts , mussels , a garbage landfill , and troubles which have yet to be revealed to the outside world .Have you heard this legend ?Liao Tianding , Taiwan \\'s Robin Hood , fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in Pali , where he fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age 27 , was murdered in the Monkey Cave at Laochienkeng -LRB- in Pali Rural Township -RRB- by one of his best friends .Countless legends grew up around Liao after his death , and the people of Pali began to worship his spirit .In 1958 , his small burial plot was converted into a huge temple .He has followers scattered far and wide , and every year on the special day appointed for making offerings at his temple -LRB- the 26th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar -RRB- , the grounds are packed with cars and visitors .The Ko brothers , now in their 60s , recall their impressions of a visit to the Liao Tianding gravesite : \" It must have been 30 years ago , we used to go there just for the fun of it .The road in front of the temple was n\\'t so wide then , and what a crowd !People were so jammed in you could n\\'t move . \"They also recall that the Pali of those days was a place in which most people lived by fishing , farming , or petty trading .The elder Ko gives a thumbs - up and declares : \" That \\'s why I always say that a can - do guy like Liao Tianding must be looking after us , so that we have developed and can even earn money from the tourists . \"Yet , he may not know about Pali \\'s real heyday , long in the past .The days of the sailing shipsPali was originally called Palifen , a transliteration of the place name used by the Ketagalan indigenous people .Located on the northwest corner of Taiwan , Pali faces the Taiwan Strait to the northwest , rests against Mt. Kuanyin to the southeast , and looks across the river toward Tanshui to the northeast .Though it does n\\'t have much of a hinterland , its geographic location has proved historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the Ta - pen - keng and Shih - san - hang archeological sites .Later , when Han Chinese began trickling across to Taiwan , they mainly settled along rivers .Because Pali is relatively close to the mainland and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that it does not have a natural harbor , in 1757 the Qing court designated it to be one of Taiwan \\'s small number of official ports for maritime transport with the mainland .Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of Pali .However , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in 1796 , Pali began to give way in importance to Tanshui , located just across the river .Once mainly dependent on fishing , Pali increasingly came to rely on farming .But the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .While the hardy people of Pali barely kept their stomachs filled , their children and grandchildren left in search of a better life .Neither the Japanese occupation -LRB- which began in 1895 -RRB- nor the return to Chinese rule -LRB- in 1945 -RRB- brought much joy or change to this rural area .But in the 1970s , urban planning came to Pali .It proved to be the prelude to a symphony -LRB- or perhaps cacophony -RRB- of transformation .Changing the rhythm of Pali lifeDuring the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in Taipei , builders put up self - described \" villas \" and \" mansions \" -LRB- apartment blocks , in fact -RRB- one after another in Pali .Also , to try to reduce the outflow of population from Pali and to get the stagnant local economy moving , the government decided to link this formerly isolated village to the outside world .What had been Chungshan Road was turned into Provincial Highway #15 , and the opening of the Kuantu Bridge to traffic linked Pali directly to the busy Taipei districts of Shilin and Peitou .Gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , Pali began to dream of a tourism boom .But fortune had other things in store .In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of Pali , the plan to develop tourism in Pali was scrapped overnight .The government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility .Then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western Taiwan for construction purposes , and a harbor was built on the Pali coast for the convenience of gravel transporters .In accordance with the urban plan , new streets were cut this way and that through Pali \\'s land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways .The sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .In 1997 , the Hsiachuotzu garbage landfill formally opened , and it became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of Pali .This rural township , which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in Taipei County , seemed resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered by many outlying areas -RRB- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others .It is only recently that the residents of Hsiachuotsu , unable to stand the smell , have begun to protest .Lin Yi - hung , born and raised in Pali , stands on the roof of his house and looks across to the beach where he used to run and play as a child .He can not help but sigh , as he looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that have come to this area : \" These construction projects have destroyed the relationship we people of Pali used to have with the sea . \"It \\'s certainly true that a lot of people here thought they would get rich from the rezoning .But just because land increases in value does n\\'t mean someone will buy it , and just because apartment complexes are built does n\\'t mean there are people who want to live there .Worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned in the struggle over divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money is involved .Lin concludes : \" I am not by any means opposed to development .But development is not necessarily the same as progress .Can the people of Pali really survive change of this magnitude ? \"All part of the plan ?One after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of Pali residents .But so far the only things Pali folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an \" otherworldly \" kind .The new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious to escape from Taipei City and return to nature .But at the same time , verdant Mt. Kuanyin - named for its uncanny resemblance to the deity Kuanyin - is covered with columbariums and cemeteries .Even Kuanyin , worshipped for her limitless compassion and mercy , must be creasing her brow at this rampant overuse of the mountain .Chen Chien - kuo , a secretary in the Pali Rural Township government , says facetiously : \" What can we do ? We have the mountains behind us and the sea in front .People say the fengshui is good here , so they come . \"He adds , in a far less amused tone , that the government has been talking about making Mt. Kuanyin a national park for a long time , and has banned construction or use of the mountain .But after 30 years , the park plan is still a non-starter , and meanwhile many cemeteries and colum - bariums have \" snuck in . \"\" Nobody seems to care about our Pali , and we are very remote , so people just dump what they do n\\'t want out here .We say that this is why we not only have a water pollution treatment plant and a garbage landfill , but also five nursing homes and hospices for the terminally ill . \"Take the Taipei Happy Mountain Colony for example .This venerable institution was first used to house leprosy victims , who met only fear and loathing elsewhere .In 1932 , a British missionary founded this home - over the strong opposition of the local gentry - to offer leprosy victims a place to live in dignity and find warmth away from the cold outside world .Today , Happy Mountain is a home for physically and mentally challenged young people , and the simple old structure , surrounded by greenery , rings with the laughter of children .Li Li - chuan , who works at Happy Mountain , was born and raised right here in Pali .Her family home is not far from the chil - dren \\'s home .\" When I was small I used to come here to play .All the adults called the kids \\' empty - headed . \\'I was small , and did n\\'t know any better , so I just called them that too . \"Stroking the head of a sleeping child with hydrocephalus , she says : \" He is so cute when he smiles ! \"Located on the margins of the island of Taiwan , the people of Pali take it in stride that they must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast off by society - waste water , trash , the deceased , and victims of diseases that society would prefer not to see at all .And there is no sign this situation will end : Reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved to Linkou for a land reclamation project there will be trucked along Provincial Highway #15 - right through the heart of Pali .Serving Greater Taipei\" I believe , \" says Lin Yi - hung , \" that the people of Pali understand that this is just the way society works -the interests of the few are sacrificed so that the majority can be better off . \"Thus , in urban plans Pali is always assigned the role of serving Taipei .\" But the government should think carefully about whether they are using the right methods or not .There are no real comprehensive policies , just short - term trade - offs of interests .There are a lot of great - sounding plans , but what do the people of Pali get out of them ?It \\'s like the port they built for transporting gravel .There are a lot of bright promises for the future , raising people \\'s hopes , but who knows what the final result will really be ? \"Chang Tsu - chou , now in his 70s , has been a secretary in the rural township government for more than 30 years , and loves Pali more than words can say .\" I was first sent here to work in the Kuomintang Public Service Department .When I came here , they were only selling about 30 newspapers in all of Pali .But I went all out to promote newspaper sales , and by the time I left the department , they were selling more than 1000 ! \"He has great confidence in Pali \\'s future , and believes the new harbor will bring prosperity .\" The government says that the first phase is for transporting gravel , but when the third phase is completed a lot of goods will be shipped in and out of here .At that time , Pali should really be hopping ! \"Pali , known as \" the home of green bamboo shoots \" for its famous local vegetable , is - like many remote areas all over Taiwan - accepting the pain and enjoying the pleasures of life in the space between hopeful expectations and disappointing letdowns .And , being marginal , it also must live with burdens that the citizens themselves do not want .Uncertain whether to makes fists or open their arms , the people of Pali watch , perplexed , as the great wheel of our times leaves its tracks through their rural township .Yet these are hardy people , who will always bounce back with a smile to face the unknown future , be it filled with troubles or glory .Pali Facts and FiguresPali Rural Township -LRB- also spelled Bali -RRB- is located at the northwestern edge of the Taipei Basin , on the western bank of the mouth of the Tanshui River .It has an area of 39.5 square kilometers and a population of just over 28,000 .It is one of the 29 townships under the jurisdiction of Taipei County .Pali produces wax apples , green bamboo shoots , and wendan pomelo which are famous far and wide for their delicate texture and sweetness .In addition , Chinese raspberries and strawberry pears are now being cultivated , with promising results so far .The main attractions include the so - called \" eight views of Pali , \" the ferry boat scenic tour , hiking on Mt. Kuanyin , Formosa Wonderworld theme park , and the Liao Tianding Temple .Pali is served by inter-city and local buses , or you can take a shuttle bus from the Kuantu Station of the Taipei rapid transit system .For more detailed information , visit http://www.bali.tpc.gov.tw/ .-LRB- The above information is provided courtesy of Pali Rural Township Government . -RRB-p. 098The red Kuantu Bridge connects Pali , a town which nestles at the foot of Mt.

              "'In the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major Hong Kong media .With people unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused Hong Kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .The world \\'s fifth Disney park will soon open to the public here .The most important thing about Disney is that Disney is a global brand .Well , for several years , although Disney was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed Hong Kong with new respect .Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland .The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .One .Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong .As this area neighbor on Lantau Island , Hong Kong International Airport had to change Hong Kong International Airport flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .Mickey Mouse \\'s new home , settling on Chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .There \\'s only one month left before the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12 .The subway to Disney has already been constructed .At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when .The subway to Disney first opens .Meanwhile , the Disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .For two years , Disney has constantly maintained Disney mystery .No media have been allowed to enter for photos .We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward Disney , trying to experience the park from close by .However , before any of the Disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards Disney .On our way back , the taxi driver gave our an explanation after understanding our intentions .Er , according to what a security guard said , for the time before everything is officially , opened , , no cars can enter unless no cars have special permission .No one can enter otherwise .Video recording is especially forbidden .Ah , everything is top secret .If pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , %pw will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .Although Disney Corporation chose Hong Kong as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit Hong Kong .From the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists , have come to Hong Kong .Well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .At this point , it has been about two years .Also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .Hong Hong Kong was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today \\'s international metropolis .Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .When in Hong Kong , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in Mong Kok .You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay , where all deities gather .You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in Hong Kong .You can ascend Victoria Peak to get a panoramic view of Victoria Harbor \\'s beautiful scenery .Or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city \\'s blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .After dark , cruise Victoria Harbor at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .Every corner of Hong Kong is filled with fun .Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the Hong Kong tourism industry bring us ?Over the past 28 years , the Ocean Park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to Hong Kong .Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird \\'s eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of Hong Kong Island and the South China Sea .These items , which were the pride of the Ocean Park , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong for some time .However , since Disney entered Hong Kong , the Ocean Park , sharing the same city as Disney , has felt the pressure of competition .To improve the Ocean Park \\'s brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .That is , the Ocean Park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .It seems that those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center will also be renovated after several years .Are those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center going to be different from what those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center are now ?those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center will be , in ten years .Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .It looks like we will also bring in whales .Er , we will implement this plan as soon as this plan is approved by the government .Groundbreaking is expected to start next year .Yes .The area of Hong Kong is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .The population is dense .Natural resources are relatively scarce .However , the clever Hong Kong people will utilize all resources the clever Hong Kong people have created for developing the Hong Kong tourism industry .Among these is the Avenue of Stars .Entering Hollywood of the East ,here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .He is my .She is my Goddess , ah .Please stay with we on New World Travel .Hong Hong Kong has always worn the crown of Hollywood of the East the East .Over the past 100 years of film history , Hong Kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .They have shortened the distance between Hong Kong and the world .Hong Kong movies have even become a window for the world to see Hong Kong , which have made the image of metropolitan Hong Kong more prominent internationally .For this reason , in 2004 , on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor , the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed the Avenue of Stars , memorializing Hong Kong 100 - year film history .Here , tourists can learn about Hong Kong film history , and can come up close with the stars in tourists mind .Hong Hong Kong is a busy metropolis .Even at dusk , Hong Kong \\'s pulse never stops beating .Across from the Avenue of Stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .%pw As our Victoria Harbor is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could our enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?So , one idea was to transform Victoria Harbor into a performance stage .Er , each key building is like a performer .It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza , Bank of China Tower , at 8:00 every Saturday night , HSBC Main Building .Their performances will be on schedule .Center of the East Central .Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island reveal the East Central .Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island one by one , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the show in full splendor .Some , er , cities have consulted with us .Uh-huh .Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .Yes .The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building \\'s reward .Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of Hong Kong hopes to be involved , so that the Hong Kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .Hong Kong Wetland Park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the Hong Kong SAR government for advancing the Hong Kong tourism industry .This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the Hong Kong SAR government for the Hong Kong SAR government people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .Hong Kong Wetland Park covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor \\'s center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .In the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .Outdoors , tourists can also personally experience wetland ecology ., er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,but behind me is Kong Wetland Park Kong Wetland Park .Ha , entirely different .Quite primitive ,er , a fresh water swamp ,er , the Wetland Park Exploration Center .Lastly , farthest away you can see Putian of Shenzhen .Then , , on the bridge is Hong Kong and outside is Shenzhen .You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .Ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many Hong Kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .Look over there .They are going to be ripe soon .The long one over there .Oh .Yes ., with ears , ah .Where ?Ah , here .Perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when children see children ., let children get some understanding .Mai Po Marshes adjacent to Kong Wetland Park is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Kong Wetland Park .These have become the best spots to observe birds .Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .It is an endangered bird species throughout the world .Uh-huh .Ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .Wow .Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to Hong Kong to spend the winter .Some of them , er , have stayed in Hong Kong Kong Wetland Park-huh .So , our park \\'s logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people \\'s attention .Uh-huh .Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .They will complete Kong Wetland Park \\'s entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign .Ah , our have established the year 2006 as Hong Kong Year .Why is that ?Because , as everyone knows , our Disneyland will open in September of this year .In addition , our will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the Giant Buddha .They add to what our already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .Moreover , er , our are including our software .Hong Hong Kong \\'s software is very well known .Like what \\'s used in our Symphony of Lights .We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year .Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .Because your line connects us with two --In recent years , Hong Kong tourist attractions have gradually moved from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and the New Territory .Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on Hong Kong Island of the New Territory .For this reason , Hong Kong Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot .The earliest to settle here was this world \\'s largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .Therefore , Hong Kong Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of China , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in the East , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of China .As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings common tourists is wonder and awe .Since the Giant Buddha settled on Hong Kong Island , the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .The important status of Hong Kong Island is increasingly apparent .No , important status of Lantau Island was totally inaccessible in the past .In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting Hong Kong , Zhuhai , and Macao .In 1992 --Could n\\'t go in summer --So , after their return , Macao , and Hong Kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .It \\'s extremely troublesome to get there via land .One has to go up to Shenzhen , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to Zhuhai , then pass through Zhuhai to get to Macao .For a Hong Kong person choosing to go there via land , it \\'s extremely inconvenient .A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .With this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .This is what we have seen since 1999 .Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .Well , originally the construction of the new --With this new Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , Hong Kong , Macao , and Zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .Macao is this way , and Zhuhai is this way .From the perspective of either Hong Kong , Macao , or Zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .Er , %pw Zhuhai for sightseeing tours , Macao for entertainment , and we have Disneyland and , other attractions in Hong Kong .Each place has different attractions of place own .So , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .Once the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge is built , the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later .Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .However , even though the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge has entered the last countdown period before the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge mysterious veil .Ah , currently the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 .There \\'s also what we call soft opening .Ah , they are now rehearsing .Ah , , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing some groups service , well , hoping that they will become used to their service , be familiar with their service , when our tourists come in September .Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to Disneyland , our tourists will certainly return home very satisfied .The Wonder Tour will start from Hong Kong .This dynamic metropolis never ceases dynamic metropolis movement .It continues to explore ; dynamic metropolis continues to open new worlds .Each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .Hong Hong Kong is a

is just one of more than a thousand different unsolved cases that scientists here at jpac are trying to solve /.In this laboratory alone I \\'m surrounded by the remains of at least twenty different service members who are in the process of being identified so that they too can go home /.The investigation begins with a team of forensic specialists who probe and study a young airman \\'s bones teeth and a young airman belongings to piece together who a young airman is /.And almost immediately clues begin to surface /.Dr. Robert Mann a forensic anthropologist has determined that a young airman was Caucasian and had fair hair /.Next though I \\'m going to have to look at Robert Mann clavicles /.The airman \\'s collar bones and pelvic bones prove that Robert Mann was in Robert Mann

update we \\'re joined by Dr. Robert Mann one of the senior scientists you just saw working on this cold case /.Thanks for spending time with we tonight doctor /.We understand since Thelma left your laboratories you \\'ve now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.is that true /?Well hi Paula /.yes we have /.Uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago we analysts and historians got to work on that /.and our analysts and historians were able to wittle that /.and down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.and at this point our analysts and historians \\'ve wittled that /.and down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.So we \\'ve gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.So how much easier will that make it for you to unlock this cold case , do you think /?Well I think this cold case \\'ll help quite a bit /.Um any time you \\'ve got a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they \\'re in pretty good condition such as this one is , it \\'s mummified remains /.We have some soft tissue we can deal with /.so we can look at the color of the hair /.we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.and that \\'s where we \\'re going to now /.So in the interest of full disclosure what I know about forensics is basically what I \\'ve learned on CSI /.and one would think that because you \\'ve got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential DNA match with what you \\'ve found in the ice /.Is it not that simple /?Well no no it \\'s not that simple /.Um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what we \\'re looking at /.And what we want to do is we do n\\'t want to just look at the material evidence that we have and immediately um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.What we want to do is have the evidence speak for the evidence /.and when we look at this individual as we \\'ve done the biological profile looking at his remains his bones his teeth and the material evidence /.and what we \\'re able to tell from this individual is that his died in his twenties his stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um his sustained massive trauma to his body on impact /.And his \\'s Caucasoid male /.and so we know much more now just one week later than what we did when his came in about eight days ago /.So the most important question is when do you think you \\'re going to know exactly who his is /?Well that \\'s the most commonly asked question that we have /.and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.Nobody knows for sure exactly when we \\'ll identify his /.What it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for successful identification /.If I were to give my best opinion in this it would be a few weeks to a few months /.Well we \\'ll be keeping we fingers crossed for you /.Know how hard

n\\'t exist yet /.Pandemic flu does n\\'t exist yet /.But a lot of people are talking about /.Pandemic flu /.and I think that \\'s remarkable to a lot of people eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that we \\'re a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the Emory University hospital in Atlanta that can take care of critically ill patients /.The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n\\'t have the surge capacity and that \\'s going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula /.Uh let \\'s talk about the other problem of the plan where Bush wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like Tamaflu and Rolenza /.Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n\\'t even presented itself /?here \\'s the important thing about that /.We do n\\'t

Holloway continues to be searched and lead suspect Joran Van Der Sloot is interrogated for the fourth straight day by a team of behavioral specialists NBC \\'s Michelle Kosinski remains in Aruba /.So Michelle the authorities really believe that uh this witness with regard to a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway \\'s credible , do n\\'t the authorities /?Well the authorities out had checked the witness who led investigators to a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway out early on just days after Natalee Holloway disappeared /.And we just found out about the witness who led investigators to a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway a couple weeks ago /.That \\'s when his existence became widely known through private investigators and other sources /.And his existence has been reported that his was afraid to come forward /.Well his existence turns out his was just afraid for his identity to be known /.but we learned that his came forward very quickly after his says his saw what happened in a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway that day just days after it happened /.He talked to police /.He talked to the FBI we found /.The the FBI we found actually went out to a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway with dogs looked around that area even before a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway became piled up with garbage /.and the FBI we found did n\\'t find anything /.It \\'s the EquuSearch volunteers who really said hey the FBI we found believe this guy /.His story does n\\'t change /.He seems to pan out /.He seems to be a lucid guy /.He seems to also be insistent that his saw something /.So his says his saw some men drive up in a white pickup truck men that his says his later recognized to be the three suspects in this case /.He says some men took what looked like a body out of the back of the pickup truck /.It was wrapped up in a bag /.But when the wind blew his says his saw the upper part of a woman \\'s body blonde hair /.and then his says some men buried a body there in a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway /.Well over a period of weeks some ten feet of garbage has piled up /.EquuSearch will tell you too that when they bring out dogs it \\'s very difficult for a dog to catch a scent in a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway when they \\'re coming across things like medical waste /.but they \\'re determined to keep going /.He saw uh a woman and inside a bag /.Her hair was blowing out with the wind /.And uh his did n\\'t say this now /.but his told that the back kind of came off and his saw half of a woman /.One of the most compelling reasons searchers say searchers believe this guy very much is that searchers say his gave searchers some clues as to things searchers would find buried deep within that garbage around that same area where his claims his saw a body things like a plastic pool /.He said that there was a dirt road buried under all that garbage /.Well searchers found those things and a couple of other items that his said would be there /.The problem is searchers just have n\\'t found any sign at all of Natalee Holloway /.but searchers want to clear that place out and just feel satisfied that searchers looked as best searchers could because it \\'s disturbing /.I mean his story has panned out in some ways /.so searchers do n\\'t want to give this up /.Well that \\'s the question I have for you Michelle /.So are you saying that the authorities uh looked into his story early on and the authorities kind of pooh - poohed it and then EquuSearch came in a couple weeks later and said wait a sec , wait a sec , let \\'s give this guy a shot here and the authorities followed up on this guy /?Yeah pretty much /.Uh the witness who led investigators to a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway told us directly that in the beginning the witness who led investigators to a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway felt like nobody was believing his story /.But us talked to a high level source in law enforcement /.and it turns out the authorities did check it out /.Hm /.They sent the FBI we found out there with a dog /.But EquuSearch says hey maybe us can do something more thoroughly here /.We can bring out teams of dogs /.But here \\'s the thing /.They still have n\\'t found one sign of her /.but uh the authorities are determined to keep it up through the weekend at least /.Alright Michelle Kosinski as always thanks a lot /.And as Michelle reported Natalee Holloway \\'s mother Beth Holloway Twitty met with the lead prosecutor in the investigation

on our program last night Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl told me the story /.A beautiful eighteen year old blonde - headed girl from New Jersey um you know was able to recount Joran /.you Joran Van Der during the month of April oh five /.And what did Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl say happened /?you know it \\'s a pretty long scenario /.We have a lot of details /.Um you know the main thing to to sum the main thing up as you know Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl how Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl entered this establishment /.I believe that you know if you enter on the right side you have to have a valid ID /.You enter Carlos N\\' Charlie \\'s on the left side you must have some type of I do n\\'t know if it \\'s a VIP pass or what to enter /.but Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl enters this establishment on the left side +approaches these group of tourist /.Um you know it \\'s interesting how /.but Joran is able to um try to work /.but Joran way in and connect establish /.but Joran in uh Carlos N\\' Charlie \\'s /.Was walking Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl around and these other tourists and was able to point out Satish and Deepak Kalpoe /.They \\'re sitting ironically in the same corner the same stools that they were seated at in the picture that \\'s been all over international media /.So that must be they spot where they wait while Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl is working /.And um you know it was so interesting how everyone in the casino knew Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl /.you know Joran /.you knew everyone was greeting all the guys with this grip handshake /.All the girls approach Joran /.you with a kiss on the cheek /.It was interesting how um you know Joran /.you was able to order these group of girls by just merely leaning over the bar and ordering three shots of one fifty - one one for Joran /.you and three for the tourists with no money /.So Joran /.you \\'s got an open uh tab at Carlos N\\' Charlie \\'s /.able to run a tab /.And you know then you notice that in a evening \\'s proceeding Joran /.you \\'s even approaching the girls getting close to closing time /.Did /.So that \\'s another unique pattern that Joran /.you has /.did she say uh anything about uh violence /?No she did n\\'t say anything about violence /.but what I was looking for was a history is a predatory type behavior which I think Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl and Deepak and Satish have and how tightly connected the three are /.Now i- /.Joining me now is the private investigator who has been uh working with Natalee Holloway \\'s family TJ Ward and his associate Harold Phipps /.Gentlemen thanks very much uh for coming on our program /.+Appreciate our program /.Thank you /.TJ let me start with you on this issue of this woman uh who came up uh to Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl /.Have you been able to follow up on that /.and how relevant do you think it is /?Uh we have n\\'t followed up with it /.Um Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl and I have talked about it /.and we will be following up on it uh here shortly /.is it relevant /?I mean a lot of my viewers wrote in saying alright so what /.this guy \\'s a pickup artist /.how does that really impact the case /?Well the case just shows it \\'s a pattern of um what /.this guy \\'s a pickup artist /.how activity is when /.this guy \\'s a pickup artist /.how hangs out at Carlos N\\' Charlie Carlos N\\' Charlie \\'s /.I mean and trying to pick women up and take women from the bar and whatever /.this guy \\'s a pickup artist /.how \\'s doing with women after that /.But if there \\'s no violence associated with that does that help you in the investigation /?Well again we do n\\'t think there was a violent issue with /.this guy \\'s a pickup artist /.how with Natalee Holloway /.We think probably +something has happened to Natalee Holloway /.and they panicked and then went forth and did what they were supposed to do /.I mean there \\'s issues that \\'s come up /.Um um well we feel something happened when Natalee Holloway was with they /.What do you mean by that /?Either /?Either either passed out regurgitated /.um something had happened /.And on top of that now there \\'s a statement that \\'s come up from Joran Van Der Sloot that he \\'s given to the police uh one of twenty - two statements he \\'s given by the way that um Deepak had uh raped Deepak and killed Deepak on the beach /.So at this point what the police have you know again we \\'re unaware because we \\'re not getting any information from law enforcement /.so we have to go on the course of information that we \\'re gathering on behalf of the family /.Well let me ask Harold how do you all know that /?I mean that information for example about that particular statement that TJ was just mentioning /.How do we know that /?Yeah how do you know that that statement was actually made by Joran Van Der Sloot /?Oh we do n\\'t /.This is the statements that were being attributed to we on those /.Uh since we have n\\'t interviewed Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl we do n\\'t know exactly what Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl has said /.but some of that statement has been let out /.and uh through a chain of different individuals uh uh they have told we uh what that statement was /.TJ just so I \\'m clear where are you getting that from that that statement was made by Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl about Deepak /?I have seen a copy of that statement from one of the local newspapers here um Diario /.Um Jossy Mansur produced and showed me a copy of that statement that uh Joran Van Der Sloot made um the last time that I was here in Aruba /.and uh Jossy Mansur conveyed it from Dutch into English and uh showed me that statement /.Uh TJ are you in any trouble there /?I mean there \\'s been a lot of discussions about the authorities getting uh annoyed about you knocking on doors and things like that /.Well it \\'s not that /.Um there was some /.the Aruban authorities /-and we \\'ve had conversations about this /.This is squared away /.It \\'s been straightened out /.Um there was uh some evidence that leaked out to the fact that had an arrest warrant for my arrest on Wednesday and that I was working without a work permit and I was going to be deported by law enforcement and Wednesday night law enforcement was looking for me to arrest me /.Uh all that is untrue /.and I want to make that perfectly clear /.Uh this was brought up by another media station here on the island that uh made claim to that /.but I can to assure /.Alright /.It \\'s not true /.We \\'ll move on /.Alright /.Yes /.Alright /.Um uh Harold finally this landfill /.Uh are you hopeful uh that EquuSearch is going to find something /?How credible do you think that witness is who says that witness saw three men dumping what looked like a blonde body /?Well uh as a retired FBI agent I \\'m always hopeful for an outcome /.Uh we interviewed the individual at length /.and having experienced hundreds if not thousands of interviews during my thirty - one years uh this guy was very uh online /.He did n\\'t go mm ah /.I mean this guy was like telling a story /.and it did n\\'t appear to me at all like this guy was coached or practiced /.Mhm /.He just told a story uh from the beginning to the end /.and I believe this guy /.I think there was something there /.if there is the body , whether the body \\'s still there is another story /.Mhm /.There has been uh a period of time since then /.and /.There could have been removed again /.But uh this guy story I think is credible /.We also had a /-TJ /.Sorry go ahead /.finish up Harold /.No go ahead /.I was just going to a- /-I \\'m out of time /.I was going to ask TJ bottom line do you think that you \\'re going to be able to crack the case in the next uh couple weeks /?Well it depends /.I believe that law enforcement uh since the FBI we found \\'s been here has been working very credibly /.Mhm /.And uh I believe that they have something um that \\'s probably solid enough and hopeful uh come September fourth that Joran Van Sloot will stay where he \\'s positioned right now /.Mhm /.and

\\'s a lot of issues with this /.if you felt that /.So was guilty , you felt /.So was a pedophile , /.So lives in your community , /.So \\'s a very powerful member of your community why let /.So free then /?Do you just not believe these jurors /?Is that the problem /?I just do n\\'t believe these jurors /.Why /?I mean these jurors \\'re making this up for money /?It \\'s just /-well uh you know I think in both these jurors cases these jurors feel now in retrospect maybe we made a mistake /.And see I can live with that if that \\'s what these jurors are saying /.but these jurors \\'re not saying that /.They \\'re saying that these jurors believed all along /.So was guilty /.and I \\'m having a hard time with that /.Alright Stacy uh stick around for a minute /.Joining me now York Daily News legal analyst former prosecutor Susan Filan and attorney and Celebrity Justice executive producer Harvey Levin criminal defense attorney Daniel Horowitz /.Harv what do you make of /-Look you \\'ve followed this close /.What do you make of all this /?Well I think Eleanor Cook who \\'s reportedly writing a tell - all book titled Guilty as Sin Free as a Bird /.News is a wacko Dan /.and I think if any of these allegations are true these jurors need to be prosecuted /.I mean this is jury tampering from within the jury if these allegations are true /.And if there is ever to be a fair celebrity trial again especially in California somebody needs to say look we are drawing the line /.You \\'re not going to get books at the end of the rainbow and do things inappropriate /.If it pans out it \\'s true I think Tom Sneddon himself should prosecute without respect to whether it would have been pro or anti Michael Jackson /.So Susan let \\'s assume for a minute it \\'s true /.Again you \\'re the prosecutor /.and you \\'re sitting there going are you kidding me /?There were two or three jurors who wanted to convict /.and they caved because they were pressured or whatever /.You ca n\\'t do anything , can you /?Nothing /.eh game over /.You ca n\\'t take an appeal from an aquittal /.The problem that I have with this is as members of the media we had an awfully difficult time with access to this trial /.If this is going to set a precedent to shut media out because these highly publicized celebrity trials yield these faulty verdicts she \\'s doing far far more harm than she could ever understand /.Yeah but let \\'s forget about the media stuff /.I mean the bottom line is the prosecutors ca n\\'t do anything about this , right /?I mean if the jurors were tampering with evidence , if the jurors were playing with evidence et cetera back there the prosecutors have to just suck it up and be depressed /.There \\'s no remedy /.They have to eat it /.It \\'s over /.Daniel I mean Stacy does n\\'t really believe the jurors /.but what do you think /?Well Dan I believe the jurors /.You know jurors are people /.We expect jurors to be perfect little robots doing what the judge says /.and jurors do n\\'t /.They \\'re going to watch television /.I \\'m sure they all watch your show /.and they all watched Susan try to convict Michael Jackson /.but then I hope they all listened to me and to reason /.But the bottom line is they all reached a fair and just verdict /.You have to trust people and nail those attempts to control and hypercontrol this case /.Just backfired /.It made the jurors feel isolated /.and now the jurors \\'re all quiet /.They wo n\\'t talk to us about what really went on /.Okay here \\'s my problem /.It \\'s this woman saying this woman was forced and bullied right into reaching the verdict that this woman did /.and there this woman is saying I did n\\'t like the way that this woman snapped at me talking about the accuser \\'s mother et cetera /. /.You know Dan I do n\\'t even talk to juries afterwards unless I win because you \\'re always going to hear things like that /.People in a jury room are in a bar room brawl /.It \\'s not supposed to be pretty /.and when it \\'s over there \\'s always second thoughts and regrets /.but it \\'s the system /.and it works /.Harvey you know what /.eh hey hey if I may say /-But Dan your point is that /-You know a bar room brawl is one thing /.They were acting like outlaws if these allegations are true /.Right /.And you know I agree Susan that the prosecutors ca n\\'t do anything to Michael Jackson /.but the prosecutors certainly can do something to the jurors /.and I think it is more important right now to say /-I \\'m telling you Dan you and I have covered a lot of trials in /.and we \\'ve seen a lot of weird things happen since OJ Simpson with books and everything else /.If jurors realize that there \\'s a back end if you will which is a Hollywood term to these trials and if they get caught so what they get caught but they can still publish a book if they believe that everything is going to change in this city /.let me ask you /.Harv here \\'s the thing that I do n\\'t understand /.And this is why Stacy made the right call on this /.Alright Stacy may say Stacy did n\\'t believe them whatever /.I do n\\'t think that many people are going to buy a book /.Is Stacy did n\\'t either /.Is that the real reason you did n\\'t want to write a book /?Well no no that \\'s not the b- /-You did n\\'t think you were going to make any money /?Come on /.That \\'s the real reason , is n\\'t it /?No /.the real reason is Dan believe it or not I have a conscience /.I wrote Man Behind the Mask with Bob Jones because I believed in Bob Jones /.and I still believe in the material /.I do n\\'t believe in the material /.uh Harvey do you agree with me that a book \\'s not really going to sell much /?Absolutely /.For two reasons /.Number one I think a book would have been a better book if Stacy would have been found guilty /.And secondly I think the credibility of the authors um mean a whole lot /.and eh you know I just think everything is so off - kilter people are n\\'t going to be particularly interested in it /.Yes /.Yeah /.Uh reminder /.you can hear from uh those two jurors who now say Michael Jackson \\'s guilty premiere of Rita Cosby Live and Direct Monday night at nine

Mediterranean York Daily News has learned federal investigators are now focusing on three men who were traveling on the cruise ship called Brilliance of the Seas two Russian brothers who live in Brooklyn and one man who lives in California /.The attorney for one man who lives in California issued this statement /.We \\'ve been cooperating with the FBI and the US Attorney \\'s Office in the FBI and the US Attorney \\'s Office investigation /.and the FBI and the US Attorney \\'s Office \\'ll continue to do so /.However we \\'ve been asked by the authorities not to speak with the media while their investigation is pending /.and we intend to honor that request /.This photo taken the day shows what appears to be blood on the awning below the cabin where George Smith and George Smith wife were staying /.Smith was traveling on George Smith honeymoon and had left Barcelona Spain on June twenty - ninth /.what was meant to be a twelve day cruise /.Halfway through the trip on the morning of July fifth George Smith disappeared /.He was reported missing later that day when a Royal Caribbean ship cruising in the Mediterranean NBC News has also learned that George Smith \\'s new wife Jennifer Hagel has been questioned is not a suspect /.Two were married on June twenty - fifth in Newport Rhode Island /.Joining me now former Connecticut prosecutor York Daily News uh legal analyst Susan Filan who \\'s been covering the case closely and Orlando police chief Walter uh Zalisko who was on the same cruise that George Smith travelled on as well as forensic expert Larry Kobilinsky /.Alright so Susan what do you know about the investigation /?Well York Daily News has learned from a law enforcement source that Smith \\'s new wife Jennifer Hagel is not a suspect and that they are focusing in on these two Russian brothers as you said who live in Brooklyn /.The California teen is apparently the key to the case at this point /.That \\'s law enforcement \\'s focus /.If this young man will talk this could break open what happened to George /.The key question is is this a tragic accident or is this foul play /?Right now law enforcement seems to think it \\'s foul play /.US attorney Kevin O\\'Connor said we have reason to believe there could have been foul play here /.Um alright uh Mister Zalisko do you know anything from your personal experience of having been on the cruise as to what happened /?Uh good evening sir /.Uh first I \\'d just like to clarify I \\'m a police chief in Oak Hill Florida not Orlando /.Uh now as far as the cruise uh I was on the cruise that uh uh day /.and the way I became aware of what occured was that uh the morning of the fifth a relative of mine had mentioned that there was blood stain on the canopy beneath a relative of mine uh balcony /.at that point we kind of dismissed that point /.We did n\\'t know what was uh going on /.Uh we then went on we daily excursion /.However later on into the cruise that day uh a Royal Caribbean ship cruising in the Mediterranean NBC News \\'s captain went onto the PA system and made an announcement that uh authorities were on a Royal Caribbean ship cruising in the Mediterranean NBC News and authorities were investigating the possibility that an individual had gone overboard during the night or early morning hours /.When I asked my cousin the uh size of the blood splatter my cousin had indicated the uh size of the blood splatter was relatively the size of a small uh dog of a beagle type /.However viewing those photographs on TV that blood splatter is much larger than uh a small dog /.Mhm /.In fact it \\'s maybe three to four feet in length /.And then we \\'ve been hearing many stories that uh there were a lot of people going into and out of the state rooms uh which would indicate that the crime scene was not properly secured in the early stages of the investigation /.Well /.Alright let me play this piece of sound from one of the passengers who was uh staying right nearby uh this particular uh room /.We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin /.Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing /.And he says uh later um chief that he heard a horrific thud /.Well yeah that would indicate that something did go on there /.and we know uh that the three individuals were in a room uh with George Smith /.And the question that has to be uh presented to everybody is why is it taking so long for authorities to interview the individual that was in a cabin next door /?Mhm /.Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after the crime /.Yeah /.Yeah /.And you would not just interview that individual next door /.You would have to take a step to interview people above below and to both sides /.Susan what \\'s the answer to that /?But Dan /.there are jurisdictional problems here /.You know it \\'s not a clear cut case as to who gets to prosecute this case /.Turkey ca n\\'t do anything without a body /.United States can /.Fair play of the United States for stepping in /.fair play to law enforcement for getting involved /.Jurisdiction is n\\'t clear /.but they \\'re working very hard to solve the crime /.I do n\\'t think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in this case /.Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got their investigators and their lawyers in from what I understand right away to make this go away /.so I think law enforcement was put in a bad position trying to play catchup Bob Jones /.and I think law enforcement \\'re doing +an amazing job /.Larry so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence /?Well it \\'s very difficult Dan /.Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body /.therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death /.But we do have some physical evidence /.Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me it was not done the proper way /.It was n\\'t a forensic photograph /.So I really do not know how large the stain was in the stain dimensions /.but it is pretty clear that there \\'s a lot of blood there great deal of blood /.It makes you think that something criminal occured /.But again getting back to how you solve the crime you got to go to the crime scene /.and I think there are multiple scenes here /.Every place there \\'s blood it \\'s a crime scene /.But the most important place is the cabin because that \\'s presumably where the injury took place /.Now there was some rumor about some arguments going casino the night before /.Uh and it could very well be that /.Uh was arguing with the three individuals /.so uh that could be the tie the connection /.and I think good policework would connect the three individuals in question with the casino with George Smith that might help us understand what happened /.this is um a little bit more sound /.This is again from Cletus Hyman uh who was literally um in a joining or nearby cabin um as to what he heard around he said four in the morning the day before uh George Smith went missing /.At times it sounded like furniture was being actually picked up and dropped Bob Jones /.and then that horrific uh thud /.Yeah I mean that sure sounds to Cletus Hyman chief like us \\'re not talking about someone who /-I mean I guess it \\'s possible if you \\'re talking about loud yelling coming /-Well look if this guy \\'s right that loud yelling is coming from the cabin right and Smith \\'s new wife Jennifer Hagel is not a real suspect here means that there was probably someone else in there /.Well there absolutely was someone else in that room /.And what \\'s interesting is there was a witness who uh had informed ship \\'s authorities that Smith \\'s new wife Jennifer Hagel had heard a scream uh early that morning /.And what \\'s really interesting is uh us do n\\'t know if Smith \\'s new wife Jennifer Hagel \\'s been interviewed at this point /.But it was five days later that ship \\'s attorneys had begun to question Smith \\'s new wife Jennifer Hagel not law enforcement but ship \\'s attorneys /.We will uh continue to follow this /.Chief Zalisko of the Oakhill Police Department sorry about that Susan Filan Larry

program /.We appreciate the program /.Alright Erin let me start with you /.What do you think the biggest problem is out there when the biggest problem comes to these sex offenders /?Well I think that there \\'s a gross misconception about sex offender crimes /.I think most do not realize how pervasive the problem is /.The sex offenders that we have caught are a very small percentage of those that are out there /.Statistically one in four girls and as many as one in six to ten boys are sexually assaulted before they are eighteen /.That \\'s nationwide /.This problem is much bigger than I think people are realizing /.And Linda I guess what we \\'re realizing as we have been highlighting these sex offenders around the country is how many of these sex offenders are still out there and wanted /.Well currently there \\'s um right now uh over a hundred thousand that are missing /.Unbelievable /.Uh we know that there \\'s over five hundred thousand registered /.So yes there \\'s a vast amount that are running uh through the PA system /.That \\'s a May of two thousand five um statistic /.but as far as those before that time and date /.Um Linda eh how much has this eh when I say changed your life I mean in addition to the obvious loss of your daughter but in terms of what you are doing everyday with your life /.both of Linda have devoted much of your lives to this cause now /.Linda why do n\\'t you tell me a little bit about what you \\'ve been doing /.Well um I \\'ve been working with um er pardon me Byron Dorgan Senator of North Dakota /.um working legislation on what has been uh called Dru \\'s Law which we hope will be a national sex +offender uh database through computer /.And um obviously we know that the country is more and um they \\'re able to access cross you know state lines /.so I think it \\'s important that uh people of predators living amongst us across you know the country and be vigilant uh besides uh leaving the pressure on people of predators living amongst us /.Mhm /.Yeah /.Erin uh every time I listen to that tape of you um talking to uh your dau- I get chills /.Um was it at all uh cathartic for you to be able to stand across from /.Um /?Definitely /.Definitely I to say what I said to /.Um /.I needed to address /.Um /.And I feel like I got it off my chest you know /.I hope to never ever see /.Um again /.The whole trial process is really built around the defendant /.and um whole trial process was very important to you that I bring whole trial process back around and make whole trial process about Samantha because that \\'s what it was really about /.Do you watch these other stories uh in Bob Jones /.and does it just get your blood boiling as you see eh these cases where was on the loose should have been arrested could \\'ve been /.You know the technology is there /.so yes the technology infuriates me /.I ca n\\'t understand why we \\'re so behind in terms of tracking sex offenders /.and I really think it \\'s because people do n\\'t real- /-there \\'s no reason that there should n\\'t be a nationwide movement to stop people . To have people register at the very least have people people driver \\'s licenses /.If people do n\\'t people go on a most wanted list /.it \\'s made public nationwide /.At the very least every state could do that /.it adds to state revenue /.it does n\\'t take away /.It \\'s a good way to track them /.And I have to just on a personal note applaud Linda /.I met Linda before they had found Dru /.and I \\'m so sorry for your loss /.I think you \\'re just amazing /.You \\'re doing such a job /.Well as well for you too /.Thank you /.Linda are you psychologically prepared uh for the Michael Jackson trial /?I mean eh you know you can tell from seeing on that tape that obviously it \\'s not easy stuff /.I mean to sit there next to these guys /.You know it \\'s just another part of this whole sick story /.there \\'s no script for it /.I do n\\'t know if anyone could ever be prepared /.Um obviously it \\'s something that um we look to have it put behind we so we can really dwell more on what Dru gave we in her life and not how tragically her was taken from we /.And also I have to say that what both of you are doing in working with legislators uh to move forward uh to not just say we \\'re going to only look past /.Both of you are doing /.and that \\'s why we \\'re so um glad and proud to have you both on the program /.It \\'s because of what both of you are doing to have things change /.um and I think that is what \\'s /-Go ahead Linda /.Well and uh thanks goes to you and to the media to help we /.Absolutely /.Obviously we could n\\'t scream loud enough uh to bring the attention /.so we hat is off to all of you as well /.Yeah /.Yeah and that \\'s /-And to realize you know why we \\'re out here doing what we \\'re doing on the scale that we \\'re able to /.and that \\'s why I have to tell you on this special series we \\'re doing I \\'m just getting so tired of hearing these stories about these guys where they were always on the loose and people say oh you know it would have been nice if he was captured /.Tired of it /.and as a result you know we \\'re doing the little bit that we can /.but we are the ones who are really going to get things done /.Your voices your presence um I think is really the difference /.and that \\'s why I thank you both so much for coming on the program /.Well thank you /.Well thank you /.it \\'s /.And you know it \\'s so important we know too /.Absolutely /.Absolutely /.It \\'s so important that people realize at home that in we own homes in we own lives we can work to prevent these crimes /.It is really just about uh communicating with neighbors getting a watch going in your community talking /-Report every suspicious behavior there is /.You never know /.It leads to convictions time and time again /.and Linda Walker thank you both so much for coming on the program /.Absolutely uh /.Thank you /.We really appreciate it /.Be right back /.Thank you /.Thank you Dan /.I \\'ve had my say /.now it \\'s time for your rebuttal /.Last night I said if the two jurors in the Michael Jackson case are really now saying that Michael Jackson \\'s guilty that \\'s shameful /.Leslie Birdwhistell from Bowling Green Kentucky /.Man you /.Ca n\\'t these people step away from the Michael Jackson trial and the ten other jurors take in some information that was not presented in court and change these people minds about the verdict /?Uh No /.It \\'s too important /.It saw the evidence /.The only thing that might \\'ve changed these people minds this quickly I think is money or peer pressure neither of which are very good reasons /.David Becker from Bradenton Florida /.Why \\'s it so difficult to believe the two jurors in the Michael Jackson case believed Michael Jackson was guilty but did n\\'t believe there was sufficient evidence to convict /?Uh maybe Dave /.but the Daily News reported that they quote flip -

I had n\\'t thought about that .Actually a shaved head is really hard to manage , is n\\'t it ?Do you have to shave it every day ?Right , yes .Um , when I \\'ve slept so much I ca n\\'t wake up , I just shave my head and I \\'m awake .And do you need to polish it somehow ?Then do you rub a little oil of some kind on it ?Oh , after I shave it I rub on a little oil .Is it cold in the winter ?Pretty cold .Do you wear a hat ?In the winter ?it forces me to wear a hat .That \\'s a question I \\'ve always wanted to ask .Um , I \\'m sure that there are many people when many people introduce you , aside from saying Director Ye Daying who has shot such and such , many people ca n\\'t avoid the cliche , many people always have to say \" I \\'d like to introduce Marshall Ye Ting \\'s grandson . \"Your father , Ye Zhengming , was Marshall Ye Ting \\'s second child .Right .Oh !But today we \\'re telling Ye Daying \\'s story .Let \\'s start with when you were young .When you were young you were very naughty .Ye Ye Daying \\'s was born in Changchun in 1958 .Although by that time his grandfather Ye Ting had been dead for 12 years , the Ye family maintained the Ye family status as a highly esteemed Communist household .The next year the Ye family transferred to Beijing , and Ye Daying \\'s spent Ye Daying \\'s childhood there .He and Ye Daying \\'s little friends went fishing , raised dogs , hunted sparrows , chased ducks , and many years later these supremely happy memories are all preserved in Ye Daying \\'s movies and plays .One , two , three , four .Ducks were the most precious asset in our village .The village mayor gave them all to village mayor .The mayor said to village mayor , there are eighty - six in all ;mayor had me check to see that there were none missing .But I never did count them all carefully .77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86Did you see ?Are there 86 of them ?Yes .Ye Ye Daying \\'s \\'s mother , An Qi , was an educated woman who worked at the Changchun Film Studio .And his father , Ye Zhengming , was an outstanding son of the revolution .Because after the Wannan Incident Ye Zhengming and his father Ye Ting were imprisoned for two years in a Kuomnintang prison .But then , and for the same reasons , just after the Cultural Revolution started , Ye Zhengming was treated as a major capitalist roader .That year Ye Daying \\'s was just eight years old .His family \\'s sudden misfortune left Ye Daying \\'s Ye Daying \\'s with very disturbing memories .He changed from a very well - behaved child into a naughty child .From that time on Ye Daying \\'s often did things that went beyond the norm , sometimes to protect Ye Daying \\'s and sometimes to take care of Ye Daying \\'s family .Ye Daying just corrected us ; Ye Daying \\'s said that Ye Ting should not be called Marshal Ye Ting but rather General Ye Ting .Right , right , right , General Ye Ting .Why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?Um , Ye Daying \\'s died in \\'46 .That marshal , afterward , after Liberation , um , it was conferred on Ye Daying \\'s , so only then --OK , us \\'ll call Ye Daying \\'s General Ye Ting .Mm .Because ,Very naughty ?To what extent were you naughty then ?In fact I was a very well - behaved child .But I was , forced into it , , if you were n\\'t naughty there was no way to survive .What do you mean forced into it ?During the Cultural Revolution , , um , the Ye family was considered capitalist roaders .So the kids then did n\\'t want to play with you , or the kids would tease you , that sort of thing .Mm .So you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,Why was that ?Was it because people for example would say that your father was such and such , or the Ye family was such and such .Right .So it was because of that sort of thing ?Right , the majority of it was like that .Mm .Mm .Because you had to face them alone , OK , a dozen people who wanted to fight you .You had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough .So that was , the only way you could overcome a dozen people who wanted to fight you .You and get the upper hand .Mm .Were you tough ?Mm .Very tough .Tough enough to --Because , there was no way , if you were n\\'t tough that was it , , how could you manage .You were the son of capitalist roaders , , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it \\'s perfectly normal .Mm ., I remember one time , we were digging out an air - raid shelter , that --Those , good kids , an air - raid shelter , that --Those , good kids went there and threw stones .I did n\\'t dare defend that , so I just had to endure it for quite a while .Mm .Finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on the head , And I got angry , so angry that I rushed out with a shovel and hit a shovel with a shovel .Where did a shovel come from ?From digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right .Mm .So you picked up a shovel and rushed a shovel .Did you crack somebody \\'s head open ?Mm , anyhow , yes , I cracked a shovel open , it was very tragic .All of a sudden nobody was making a sound .Very --Once I fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me .How many of them did you take out ?I hit one of them and that was enough .Nopbody went to get the schoolmaster or somebody \\'s father ?the schoolmaster or somebody \\'s father did , and there was a huge fuss .Mm .Because when I was little , having a big fight like that .Mm .Anyhow , more or less , , on average , every two years I changed school , and that \\'s how it had to be .Mm .I remember one time -- Mm , also , when I was in fifth or sixth grade , someone yelled out , Down with Ye Zhengming , someone was yelling at someone , and I had to fight them .Mm .After the fight I went home , and your father was standing far away ., the factory , , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters Down with Ye Zhengming , , the slogan .Mm .I got accustomed to it while passing by at that time , and now when I think about it , it seems very much like a stage play .Mm .Back then I felt , looking at your father standing so far away --I walked over to your father , and your father said , um , you really do n\\'t understand anything .At the time I felt like I had a grievance .And I felt , I was fighting for you , the people were cursing you , and I was fighting the people .In fact that \\'s the way kids think .Mm .You think , you bastard .What you say does n\\'t count .you come after someone and I \\'ll take you down .You come down , and I \\'ll take you down .If you have balls , you come on down .Come on down .Come down .Come down , come on , fight , fight , fight .I say you take a whack .Whack .I \\'m telling you , if you kill somebody you \\'ll pay with your life , do you understand ?, You \\'ve already handed your father over .I sent someone .OK , OK , I sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at someone .Come on , take a whack at someone .Take a whack at someone .Your dad knows who broke the window .Take a whack .Take a whack .Take a whack .Are n\\'t you willing to be friends with us ?Yes , I am .He says .He \\'s willing .Did you hear ?.He says .He \\'s willing .Ok , that \\'s all right , let \\'s go play .This is a movie directed by Ye , called There \\'s a Place Called Wangjiazhan .Wangjiazhuang , right .This is obviously .He as a boy , uh , a memory of .He childhood life .Right .Right .Which child is you .Is this child you , or is that child you ?Actually we should be accurate ; child \\'s experiences ,So this child ,Um , right , right , right , because once , IMy father was denounced , and then the rebels took we , took child to see .Mm .They denounced your father , so I was very indignant ,They let a lot of people expose my father ,Mm .Then the day after I took a kitchen knife and ran over to They home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that I \\'d hack the guy up .A kitchen knife ; a knife from your kitchen at home .Oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .Then I was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n\\'t just hack people up .But I had already said it .What did you say ?said I have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like child .But , those adults standing around reasoned with me , said look , you do n\\'t understand this .If you do this , you \\'ll stir up more trouble , and then wo n\\'t your dad be even worse off ?In fact when those adults standing around said that , my mind had already eased .I could not lose the face this way , , So then I ran over and took a whack at the door , to get an excuse for me .Was it all ruined ? the door --I slashed the door twice .Um , was n\\'t there any consequence ?Mm , there was no consequence , , I just let the adults reason with me .Mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .It , had a great influence on me .Including that village , that environment , it \\'s all very familiar to you .More or less , very close to me , this is a novel of .Mm .Mm ., the reason I like it is because , um , it brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories .Mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in Beijing .What year was it that you moved to Shanghai ?How old were you at that time ?, In \\'69 I was 11 years old .Mm .Mm , well .In \\'69 at the age of 11 you went from Beijing to Shanghai .Mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n\\'t completely passed .Mm , as as puts as , looking at as now , some of these supremely happy memories can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .I went there every day and then some of the memories suspended classes , , so I could n\\'t go to school , could n\\'t go to class .Mm .So , later I remember there was -- Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , he said , now take this , now take Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you \\'ll take up arms and teach yourselves .A lot of people were very happy , very excited , because lot of people were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?Right , but the problem --Because , I had never studied well ,In 1966 the Cultural Revolution came , and at that time Ye Daying \\'s family moved from Beijing to Shanghai to live .His Ye Zhengming was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .And the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of Ye Daying \\'s life .He was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .When you got to Shanghai the environment changed ; did n\\'t your whole person change ?After I got to Shanghai , , settling into , , that ,All that time , from \\'69 to \\'76 , I graduated from senior middle school , it all took place there .Mm .At that time in school , there were some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in that class ?Right , right , , see , like study classes to educate good kids .What kind of people were in that class ?Um .Anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say they were little hooligans , they were all mixed in together in that class , and there were also some who had problems at home .Mm .All of they , and every day I went there , and the classes were suspended , , so the classes did n\\'t let me go to school , did n\\'t let me go to class .Mm .So , afterward , I remember there was Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , he said , now take this , now take Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you \\'ll take up arms and teach yourselves .Lots of fun .Mm .So I was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .In fact it was n\\'t that we did n\\'t study , I think it was ,that class really helped me a lot , , sometimes in my life I think about this ,Mm .That period was both a happy and a fun time .Because I was a good egg .In this I go against the grain .Um , the thing is , , both \\'re all the same .If you \\'re bad , you do what you want , and so , you \\'re honest and so it \\'s easy to be free .Plus when you yourself have already decided that you \\'re a bad kid , then , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you \\'re completely liberated and free .I think that --Um , of course today we say , at that time , um , in that class of we , they were n\\'t all necessarily bad kids .Mm .They just were n\\'t like normal kids ., it was like a brotherhood .Ah , and we did some things that were out of bounds .Mm , we helped each other .Very sincere , very sincere and good .When he was in that class , Ye Daying received patient teaching every day .At that time he encountered the first love of he life that still remains fresh in he memory .This girl became the only light in Ye Daying dark life for several years .In those days if a middle school student liked a fellow - student , how did a middle school student go about expressing that ?Um .When I was a school kid , for example , Um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , I liked this girl .Mm .I always felt , um , this girl can , give you more on your plate , put more things on your plate for you to eat .And then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together .Mm .It was ,So already you could -- Go see a movie ; I thought ,That was it , that was it .You just want to go see a movie , you do n\\'t worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , --So you went to the movies with this girl ?Yes .Do you still remember the movies with this girl you saw ?this girl .I still remember that now .Mm .She cried as hard as this girl could .So seeing this girl was the equivalent of seeing Titanic now .Oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .Yes , crying this girl eyes out , a big film like that .At the time I thought I would n\\'t cry .But the people all around were crying , and I thought if I did n\\'t cry if would look bad .So then you cried .So then I thought , I should let my emotions go .Um , how was this girl , was this girl very pretty ?, now I remember that this girl was very pretty , mm .Mm .She was a very good student .Ha ha , this --How was it this girl liked you ?At that time we did n\\'t talk about it , if two people gave each other the eye and felt the eye was right , then ,Gave each other the eye , while you were in the class you gave each other the eye ., so , when we were in class , for example you ,I remember how it happened , yes .Um . When we went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .Mm .Mm .So then , we \\'d each pick up a piece of chalk and toss chalk back and forth . And throw spitballs .I threw chalk at someone else but missed , and chalk hit this girl .The result was that this girl turned this girl head to look .And this girl looked at you angrily .I thought , uh-oh , the expression in her eyes was like this girl would forgive you , that kind of feeling .I thought wow , it \\'s so wonderful , that kind of feeling .Mm .That \\'s how it was , I should say .It was like that ?Mm .Many years later , afterward , we graduated from senior middle school , and I was still going to see this girl .Mm .The --, so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .You graduated from middle school in \\'73 .\\'74 .Mm .Graduated from midle school in \\'74 .Mm , that female schoolmate went to the Shanghai suburbs to live and work .Right , right , yes .Ye Ye Daying went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were , forty - some yuan ?Mm , when I started it was a technical school .Then at first it was 13 yuan , the first year 13 yuan ; the second year it was 15 yuan , and the third year it was 41 yuan .Mm .Mm .41 yuan , at the time , for .41 yuan , it was , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money .It was a lot of money .In 1976 , there were two happy events in the Ye family .The first was that his father , Ye Zhengming , was released and reunited with his that his had been separated from for three years .The second event was that Ye Daying had Ye Daying 18th birthday and became an adult .With the turn for the better in Ye Daying father \\'s political circumstances , Ye Daying left behind Ye Daying violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking .In 1978 the big news was that the college entrance exams would be reinstated nationwide , and people of Ye Daying age were thrilled .However , at this time Ye Daying , facing this opportunity that would change Ye Daying fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .You thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?Oh my , in fact , \\'78 , for me , was an especially depressing time .Mm .Mm .Up to then , um , I had never thought about the future .Mm .I thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -LRB- factory -RRB- worker .In society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead .Um , in \\'78 suddenly they reinstated the college entrance exams .At that time , in \\'78 , I was 20 .A lot of people were happy , very excited , because lot of people reinstated the college entrance exams ; why were you feeling depressed ?Right , but the problem was , , Because , I had never done well in school .So right off I felt that I was finished , --Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school , , compared to me , --Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school had a future , um , --Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school could stand out .Mm .So I was hopeless , right off I was feeling down .Very clearly a --If you wanted to take the college entrance exams , what kind of score did you think you \\'d get .I did n\\'t take the college entrance exams , I did n\\'t have the nerve , I did n\\'t try , so --, the extraordinary thing was , at that time my mom was attending the film institute , my mom was an instructor there .Mm .Mm , I had n\\'t thought , , that I would work in the movie .Mm ., um , my mom wanted to send the recruitment announcement to a friend \\'s house .Mm .So then I --One day my mom sent me to deliver a friend \\'s house , and so I picked a friend \\'s house up and read a friend \\'s house , and once I read a friend \\'s house , oh ! The directing department of the film institute , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and I thought wow ! This is just the ticket .Let \\'s run off to try and see .I thought you \\'ve loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , I want to be a director .No , I did n\\'t , no .It was just because there was no English exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .Right , it was very simple .Mm .One more thing , because in \\'78 , the Beijing Film Institute was recruiting students in Shanghai --Right .So , Ye Daying went to take the exams for the film institute , but did n\\'t pass the exams for the film institute .His mother , An Qi , had never thought that Ye Daying would sign up to take the exam for Ye Daying work unit , the Beijing Film Institute .But Ye Daying in fact failed when Ye Daying took the exam .Although it was the first time Ye Daying had taken the exam , the exam left Ye Daying even more convinced that movies were something Ye Daying could do .The next year , 21 - year - old Ye Daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at the Xi\\'an Film Studio .Being an actor was not an actor goal ; an actor hoped rather to get into the directing profession .At that time you especially admired directors , right ?Mm , because after I got to the Xi\\'an Film Studio , um , I discovered I had the shakes when I got on stage .Mm .Mm . Now , here chatting with you , I feel , um , it does n\\'t matter .Even today , in front of the lens , I \\'m a nervous wreck .Mm , very tense .Did you act then ?Of course , every day we had to , um , it was n\\'t just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that .I thought , this is definitely not working .Just getting on stage gave you the shakes .Then , , no , it was n\\'t my thing , this , I could n\\'t find out why , and besides in those days ,Um , it was in \\'80 that I went to the Xi\\'an Film Studio ,Mm .At that time , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing .And I \\'m not that kind of person , so I could n\\'t get my bearings .So then at the same time when I saw that Teng Wenji , Teng Wenji was probably thirty - some years old , Teng Wenji was the previous generation to us , very stubborn .Mm .Mm .That projecting force of Teng Wenji , I thought wow , , that \\'s really good .He could really project .Because ultimately , there , I gradually realized this .Mm .And I would be in the audience and see Teng Wenji directing on site .Mm .Mm , I could see how they worked .In fact in the beginning the attraction to movies was all these things , I thought it was really a bunch of fluff , I thought , that \\'s really fun , that \\'s really interesting .I thought who was stubborn , then I wanted to be that kind of person , but that did n\\'t mean I knew anything about that profession .So no one ever came looking for you to do a play ?At that time --Mm , no one ever came looking -- .They looked , but it was always just for an extra ., you did n\\'t even have any lines .Mm .That Xi\\'an Incident thing , I played an extra once .There was a guy playing Zhang Xueliang , and I played his secretary going in to report to his , and I did it a few times but I was always in the wrong place .What were your lines supposed to be ?It was \" reporting , a telegram \" that sort of thing .So you --So I had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful .So after I gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing .So the old director , Cheng Yin , um ,Mm .He would say , this is An Qi \\'s son , why is An Qi \\'s son like that ?Do you remember how many takes you did ?Oh , a lot .I think it was something like ten plus times .It was too , I \\'d walk badly and turn like that ., I attended that class for half a year , um , um and then I got sick .Um , I got , , an inflammation of the central nervous system , so my whole body was paralyzed .Your my whole body was paralyzed ?Right .Your my whole body was paralyzed ?Right . I was paralyzed for ten months .So you could n\\'t move at all .I could n\\'t move at all .When my whole body started , my leg went numb , then my hand went numb , and then my hand started cross over , like that , and then slowly , slowly , slowly I could n\\'t move .What \\'s the scientific name of the disease ?the disease \\'s called Guillain - Barre Syndrome .It \\'s named after a foreigner .Mm .Ahem , if naming the disease somewhat common , it \\'s , a paralysis of the central nervous system , um , the disease goes from the nerve endings to the flesh , and , then the disease turns into myasthenia .And how did you get better , later ?Hormones .You took hormones .Um , , every day I had a transfusion .Mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat .Mm .Very fat .I \\'m so fat now , but compared to then it \\'s much better , in fact .At that time how fat were you ?Yah .Getting so fat , it was this , if I looked down I could see my own cheeks , so I thought I was really fat .What do you mean ?If I just look down , my own cheeks are right here .But after If finished with the hormones , I gradually got better .Mm .The flesh all atrophied , um .If you look at when I was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --Later , based on that , it all evaporated .I \\'ve heard it said that that Wang Shuo novel , which we later saw as a television play --Sometimes , oh , right .Mm .Get some fun .Get some fun .The language in that , the part Wang Zhiwen played , the disease Wang Zhiwen got is about the same as your disease , is n\\'t it ?Right , right , right , right .So sometimes , oh , it was me and Wang Shuo , together , it was , um , in \\'89 .Mm , together , um , wrote a -- .Aye , the script I wanted , the novel Wang Zhiwen wrote , um , that piece we created together .Mm .Therefore , at that time , we were talking and talking to shoot , an urban love story , tell a love story , so .Therefore took me , at that time , , more or less that story , as background .Mm .Then after I went back to Beijning , when we made arrangement and were eating together , I saw Wang Shuo for the first timeThen , when I saw Wang Shuo for the first time , Wang Shuo was holding a book in Wang Shuo arms , a book , that was Floating on the Sea , that novel Wang Shuo wrote , it was a sample .Mm .Gave it to Wang Shuo , and I took it back to school to read .I read it and wow , that day , I thought Wang Shuo would be able --Our generation could really find ourselves , I mean --Um , in the end I knew ourselves --Why ourselves studied movies , um , and why wrote things , expressing one \\'s own kind of thing is the most accurate personYe Ye Daying had already read Wang Shuo novel Love the Hard Way , and the story and the style it was written in made a profound impression on Wang Shuo .He sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express .Later Wang Shuo was introduced by a friend , and Ye Daying met the author of the novel , Wang Shuo , at the film institute .That was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today .How many plays did you collaborate on ?Today , U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen promised to catch and punish those responsible for the bombing of the `` Cole \\'\\' and defended the Navy \\'s decision to refuel ships in Yemen as investigators continued investigators day at work .Morton Dean reports it \\'s a difficult day for the sailors remaining on board .The stressful , monumental task for the crew on the U.S. carrier suffered a setback .The ship began to take on water and lost electrical power again .A difficult time became even more difficult .It led to the cancellation of a memorial service planned for the 17 sailors who lost their lives .Details are becoming known about the damage , most obvious , the huge hole , but also the deck is buckled .Even the superstructure is damaged .Hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed .Rear Admiral Mark Fitzgerald , who visited the `` Cole \\'\\' , was stunned by the damage .I wo n\\'t tell you whether the `` Cole \\'\\' is going to sink or not sink , but there was considerable damage to the `` Cole \\'\\' .According to U.S. officials here tonight , the most important questions about the attack remain unanswered .Any details or speculation on who specifically , we do n\\'t know that at this point .With well over 100 U.S. investigators now in Yemen , the search for evidence is now fully under way .It \\'s been officially designated `` Operation Determined Response , \\'\\' and that suggests several things that U.S. , of course , is determined to discover who carried out the bombing of the `` Cole \\'\\' and that any group who helped plan the attack faces a response from the U.S. military .The U.S. believes there are anti-American terror groups based in Yemen .Half the population lives in settlements with 500 people or less , and senior U.S. officials here say Yemen , although friendly to the United States , does not have full control over Yemen .Yemen \\'s President has repeatedly said an internal explosion rocked the `` USS Cole , \\'\\' but tomorrow U.S. officials expect .Yemen \\'s President to announce that .Yemen \\'s President has changed .Yemen \\'s President mind , and tomorrow , the search for bodies will resume .Ten U.S. sailors are still missing .Morton Dean , Yemen .To learn more about Yemen , go to our website at abcnews.com .The remains of four sailors killed in the bombing of the `` Cole \\'\\' returned to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware today .They were the last of the dead to be flown home , but in Yemen , the search for those responsible for the bombing of the `` Cole \\'\\' continues .Investigators turned up new evidence and more leads today .ABC \\'s John Miller reports .Investigators have searched at least half a dozen homes around the port of Aden including this one , trying to retrace the movements of what they believe may be six or more suspects .This house on Al Zaharah Street half a mile from the port is where investigators believe the bomb was built into the boat that carried the bomb .Just after the men moved in , neighbors say the men erected a metal corrugated wall to block neighbors view of the yard .Investigators say the men worked on the boat behind these walls in the last few days of the men stay almost constantly .At first , neighbors were curious , but later neighbors complained about the noise .On the day of the bombing of the `` Cole \\'\\' , neighbors saw the boat leaving through these gates pulled by a Nissan 4 x 4 truck .The trip from house on Al Zaharah Street to the harbor was only about a mile , then six miles by water to the spot where the American destroyer was refueling .Today , FBI agents and divers were collecting evidence near the place FBI agents and divers believe the boat was lowered into the water just before the attack on the `` USS Cole \\'\\' which killed 17 sailors and two suicide bombers .Investigators have come up with a series of names of possible suspects found on papers in the houses and cars the attack on the `` USS Cole \\'\\' which killed 17 sailors and two suicide bombers .Investigators searched .In some cases , some cases have some names .They have not been able to verify whether whether \\'re accurate , true names .In other cases , I do n\\'t believe other cases have identities yet .Yemeni sources say some of two suicide bombers may have used ID cards issued by a government registration center 35 miles from Aden .Today , at the walled - in headquarters of the government security agency , the manager of that center and several clerks who worked there were among dozens who have been detained and questioned .Investigators are aware that a few weeks before the bombing of the `` Cole \\'\\' , accused terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden released a videotape calling for holy war against Americans in the Gulf .American investigators also say the way two suicide bombers organized the plot in Aden has stark similarities to the way terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden cells have operated in the past , but , investigators concede , while investigators are closer to learning the names of two suicide bombers , investigators are still a long way from knowing or proving who sent investigators .John John Miller , ABC News , Aden .We have an exclusive report tonight about the `` USS Cole , \\'\\' and an identical attack that was planned , but failed , several months earlier .Here \\'s ABC \\'s John M Wethy .ABC ABC News has learned that the terrorists who attacked the `` USS Cole \\'\\' originally planned to hit a different American warship in the same port ten months earlier .The attack was to be part of a worldwide effort during celebration of the millennium that included targets in Jordan and Seattle .Intelligence sources say the target was to be a destroyer , the `` USS The Sullivans , \\'\\' which refueled in Yemen \\'s port of Aden in January .Sources tell ABC News that a suspect who has been in custody for several weeks told Yemeni investigators that a suspect who has been in custody for several weeks group failed in his group because his group small boat , overloaded with explosives , sank just off the beach .The a suspect who has been in custody for several weeks said it took months to repackage and redesign the load of high explosives that was eventually used against `` the Cole . \\'\\'ABC \\'s John M Wethy .ABC , ABC News , the Pentagon .Good evening .That call to order you just heard reverberates through the Supreme Court every day that the justices convene , but today was no everyday session .Never before has the Supreme Court taken up a case that could decide a presidential election .It did today .That session of the Supreme Court and two defeats for Al Gore in Florida courts dominate the news today .We start with the Supreme Court , specifically at issue , an appeal from the campaign of George W. Bush that the Supreme Court had exceeded the Supreme Court authority when the Supreme Court ruled Florida counties could have more time to hand - count ballots .Throughout an hour and a half of argument , the justices were aggressive in peppering lawyers with questions , and the justices seemed interested on two issues .Was there a federal issue involved that would even require the Supreme Court to rule ? and if so , did the Supreme Court improperly rewrite Florida law , as George W. Bush contends ?A sure sign of the historic nature of the day \\'s proceeding , for the first time ever , the Supreme Court immediately released an audiotape of the arguments .But in the courtroom , listening in person was ABC \\'s Jackie Judd .Even now , hours after that hearing ended , there are still protesters circling the Supreme Court .As boisterous as protesters circling the Supreme Court were , nothing intruded on the ritual inside .The chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States .The courtroom was packed .Al Al Gore \\'s top campaign aides , Al Gore children , Republican senators and congressmen , nothing intruded on the ritual inside .The chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States .The courtroom were all there .God save the United States and the Supreme Court .First up , Ted Olson lawyer for George W. Bush , laying out the campaign of George W. Bush \\'s main claim .Olson made it through only 56 seconds of Ted Olson arguments before a justice broke in .Well , Mr. Olson --Sandra Day O\\'Connor , often the swing vote on the Supreme Court , demanded to know why the Supreme Court even had a role in this case .Olson argued that a century - old federal statute prevents laws governing an election from being created after the fact which , Ted Olson claimed , is just what the Supreme Court Florida did , and also , that the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures , not the courts , the right to choose electors .Of the justices it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg who seemed most sympathetic to the Supreme Court .Midway through the hearing , Chief Justice Rehnquist seemed to scold Chief Justice Rehnquist colleagues for being too talkative when Chief Justice Rehnquist made an unusual offer to the lawyer representing Florida \\'s Attorney General .And so it went on .Laurence Tribe , Al Gore \\'s attorney , said the Supreme Court did nothing illegal .It simply provided a way for a close election to be examined .Justice O\\'Connor again , but this time suggesting the Supreme Court had overstepped its authority and perhaps there was a federal case here .Justice Antonin Scalia also pressed Tribe .He said the Supreme Court relied on the U.S. Constitution to draft the U.S. Constitution decision , excluding state lawmakers and that violated the U.S. Constitution .It was Justice Breyer who asked the most straightforward question of all .What happens if the Supreme Court rules in favor of George W. Bush ?The answer from the lawyer representing Florida \\'s Attorney General was , George W. Bush wins and all the litigation in Florida ends .Not everyone agrees .They say that no matter which way the Supreme Court rules , the Supreme Court will not provide nearly so much finality to this presidential election .Charlie ?ABC \\'s Jackie Judd at the Supreme Court .Our thanks .The the `` Cole \\'\\' has arrived back at the Mississippi shipyard where the `` Cole \\'\\' was built .ABC \\'s John M. Wethy reports tonight before the attack on the `` Cole \\'\\' , the crew failed to take at least 25 % of the 80 different steps to protect the `` Cole \\'\\' before landing in Yemen .An investigation is already under way .The ship \\'s captain is going to take a lot of heat for the 17 sailors who died .The ship will sail again .After George W. Bush is sworn in , Bill Clinton will head to New York .The George W. Bush has said George W. Bush and George W. Bush wife , now a New York senator will spend weekends at he and his wife , . Bill Clinton will also spend time at Bill Clinton presidential library in Arkansas .He says Bill Clinton will come to Washington , `` every now and then . \\'\\'Thanks for joining us .Here \\'s us story this half hour --There \\'s dancing in the streets of Belgrade as angry demonstrations have turned into celebrations .Tens of thousands of people crowded the streets of the Yugoslavian capital today after the apparent overthrow of President Slobodan Milosevic .Yesterday , protesters stormed key government buildings and seized Serb state television in Belgrade .Russia has joined the West in the West support of opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica .Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov congratulated opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica on Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov election victory .He also gave Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin .Putin says Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov hopes Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will do `` everything possible to overcome the internal political crisis \\'\\' in Yugoslavia .Russia was the last European power to withhold support for the opposition .The man who lost power in Yugoslavia finally surfaced today .Slobodan President Slobodan Milosevic met with Russian .Ivanov says President Slobodan Milosevic told President Slobodan Milosevic President Slobodan Milosevic plans to remain in Serbia and continue to run the Democratic Party of Serbia .Indeed President Slobodan Milosevic still considers President Slobodan Milosevic to be President , according to President Slobodan Milosevic brother Borislav .In an interview with CNN , President Slobodan Milosevic accused Western nations of supporting the demonstrations and said his brother Borislav has no plans to leave the city .Regardless of how many votes opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica received , the actions that took place last night are vandalism .It \\'s violence .It should n\\'t have happened .That \\'s not democracy .The opposition did n\\'t accept the ruling of the Supreme Court and began to storm the parliament , which was not being defended , and inflicted huge material damage , but the ruling of the constitutional court also did more damage to our institutions .The next step in the transition to a new government is for the Yugoslav parliament to convene .A commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to Belgrade for a special session .Alessio Vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of parliament will have to travel to Belgrade from Montenegro .What is going on right now is intense negotiations with all the members of parliament that were elected on September trying to get the majority needed in order to swear in opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica as the next President of Yugoslavia .With the events of the past week in Yugoslavia , the world is getting to know the name of opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica .Jonathan Mann takes a look at the man and Mann politics .Unlike President Slobodan Milosevic , President Slobodan Milosevic was not a Communist in the long years when party membership was the key to power .He was not among the prominent opposition figures who have struggled against each other almost as hard as the regime .He is an orthodox Serb nationalist , but President Slobodan Milosevic supports truer democracy for Yugoslavia and better relations with Yugoslavia neighbors and the West .Kostunica is a soft -

the country \\'s health care system .China requires foreign broadcasters to use a Chinese satellite to serve foreign broadcasters .Until last month it was routinely blocking almost all reports about Sars in China , a practice that has produced intense global criticism .The British Broadcasting Company has also faced the censorship in China .In 1993 Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling stake in China \\'s Star TV satellite system .In 1994 the BBC World Service broadcasts were pulled from Star .China was offended by the BBC \\'s news content and demanded that STAR TV remove the BBC \\'s news content or lose permission to broadcast in China .A year later Rupert Murdoch bought the rest of STAR TV that he did not own .Rupert Rupert Murdoch \\'s News Corp. has an extensive presence , of course in China .That presence may be expanding soon , if the FCC eases some of the FCC broadcast rules .Murdoch has lobbied hard for those changes .They would allow .Murdoch to buy even more U.S. television stations .Next month the FCC the FCC is likely to accommodate .Murdoch .Murdoch today promised that if the rules are changed .Murdoch will limit future purchases to a few of what .Murdoch calls sizable markets .Let \\'s talk a little bit more about what the Navy does to prevent such tragedies .We were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .I \\'ll try to explain it the best I can from what I remember from being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln \\'\\' .This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the Navy does with regard to prevention ., every sailor that \\'s entering the Navy does take a swim test .They learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .Also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment .Usually twice a day , sailors \\'re practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but those know where to go quickly .They also wear float coats .You can see those here .The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .Everything is color coordinated .You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and those have toggles to pull and inflate .They also have a manual device so if the toggles do n\\'t work those can blow air into a manual device .They have dive goggles and those \\'re able to find those .It also has a strobe light and a whistle .Also such location devices , some ships have smoke floats they can toss out so a man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to , let the rescuer locate them .Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout is jumping ship .She , all around is jumping ship .She , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of is jumping ship .She , not all around is jumping ship .She , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .Now let \\'s talk about a man and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .You will hear a P.A. announcement around is jumping ship .She , there is a man overboard so everyone knows everyone have to react quickly .A ship - wide search will happen if ship - wide search do n\\'t see that person go overboard , but if indeed ship - wide search do see someone go overboard , is jumping ship .She starts to circle that area continuously .Also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .Inside those helicopters rescue swimmers .If indeed a man is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .If a man is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those helicopters rescue swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull those helicopters rescue swimmers up into the helo and pull those helicopters rescue swimmers back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .The search crews will go 24 hours before calling off a search .Why call the ship for treatment off ?There \\'s a number of reasons to look at .Depending on the water temperature , it \\'s very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they \\'ve exhausted all resources by that time .Anyway , we \\'ll continue to follow what \\'s happening on the `` USS Nassau \\'\\' as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors .Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas scheduled to meet today , those investigations second chance now to discuss the Bush administration \\'s road map for Mideast peace .Both sides will meet with Bush when Bush arrives in Mideast Mideast next week .Our Jerusalem bureau chief Mike Hanna standing by with more and that .Mike ?In the African nation of Nigeria , an Islamic court delayed the appeal of a woman condemned to death by stoning .The court says court will not hear this case until late August .The 31 - year - old mother of three was convicted in March of

guest this morning faced 100 lashes for premarital sex in Pakistan .She was there as a journalist in the wake of the 9 / 11 attacks .She has written about her experience in the book `` Tantrika \\'\\'

sentence of 100 lashes , had not yet been sentenced that ?Back in this city , a courthouse in Manhattan .Sam Waksal , founder and former CEO of ImClone is scheduled to be sentenced today .He pleaded guilty earlier this year to insider trading , bank fraud and tax evasion .Waksal could be fined $ 3.5 million , facing a maximum of 75 years in prison , expected , though , to receive about six to seven years .That \\'s the early indication we \\'ve been given .A friend of his , Martha Stewart , pleaded not guilty last week .The charges related to friend of his , Martha Stewart sale of ImClone stock .She sold the share a day before bad news about British Broadcasting Company sent the stock price falling , considerably .Sam Waksal , sentenced , 10:00 a.m. , local time here in New York

parachutes are , let me tell you what the U.S. Treasury Secretary is saying about it now .John Snow making some comments a short time ago saying the U.S. Treasury Secretary backs tougher oversight for British Broadcasting Company .He also says the U.S. Treasury Secretary department is trying to determine if his department has implication for the African nation of Nigeria \\'s financial system

win a crucial swing state , Florida .25 electoral votes .It \\'s being fought over hard .With a look at how the candidates are getting out the vote there , here \\'s Sanders .The image of Florida , both fact and fiction .A great getaway , a state where a mouse wields more power than a tropical paradise .While the mild winters make this comfortable living for almost three million seniors , the largest elderly population in the United States , this year this year is not the weather drawing Al Gore and George W. Bush to the Sunshine State .Both candidates list 25 reasons to keep coming back , Florida \\'s 25 electoral votes .Polls show Florida is still up for grabs .Both candidates have been here almost equally .In fact , it \\'s almost I dare you politics .Each of candidates dares the other one to spend less time , money , and energy than candidates are at candidates own peril .Elderly voters once again in Florida , the most important voting bloc because Florida , the most important voting bloc actually vote more than any other group .In this election , 45 % of those going to the voting booth are expected to be over the age of 65 .The issue most important to those going to the voting booth , Social Security .Pay down the African nation of Nigeria \\'s debt , strengthen Social Security , cut taxes for middle class family , save our environment .Experience .Vision .Values .Al Al Gore .Why does Al Gore say one thing when the truth is another ?Al Gore attacks on Bush Social Security plan , exaggerations .The truth , nonpartisan analysis confirms Bush plan sets aside $ 2.4 trillion to strengthen Social Security .Both candidates repeatedly talking about that one issue , but in Florida where there are more than 550 children born every day , families drive the other campaign issues .Polls show education , the environment , and the candidate \\'s character will influence who voters choose .And in this diverse state with a 15 % Hispanic population , candidates courting candidates votes in ways not seen in any previous election .Following both conventions , Al Gore and Bush granted both conventions , Gore and Bush first live TV interviews to this man .His name , Jorge Ramos , the Tom Brokaw of Spanish language news .The race gets really , really close , and let race suppose that states like Florida and Illinois might decide this election .maybe , maybe Hispanic votes might decide , too , who would be the next President of the United States .The largest Hispanic voting bloc of Florida , Republican voters who do not seem to be crossing the party line .Gore wanted the young Cuban boy , Elian Gonzalez to stay in this country .Joe Lieberman brings Al Gore support Lieberman probably would have gotten here anyway .Sizable Jewish and African - American voting blocs .Of the United States , Florida is the most Republican .The Republican governor here , Bush was once expected to deliver Bush brother this state .The managers of both campaigns saying in the end , the wipper may simply be determined by who gets more people to the voting booth .Kerry Sanders , NBC News , Anaheim .There was , of course , a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over the weekend of the trial going on in the courtroom in Florida , and , of course , among the teams of lawyers on the Bush side , one of the leaders , Ben Ginsberg , one of the lawyers who argued the case in Leon County Circuit Court .He \\'s with us tonight , victorious in Tallahassee , Florida , and Ben , whatever the outcome today , and you were on the upside , you are forced now to go along with the appeals process as is the right of the Al Gore team .What is your reaction to the work that will cause ?Well , I mean , us \\'re certainly prepared to brief all the issues .I think that the circuit court judge , Judge Sauls gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of Florida law .Well , let \\'s talk about your statement earlier today that Bush -- I guess you were asked should Bush concede , and you answered , Bush should do what \\'s best for the United States .Is that what you \\'re trying to say ?Well , sure .I mean , I think that all the people involved in this unique situation , the first time a presidential election in our history has been contested , Brian , need to do the right thing , and I \\'m sure do the right thing , as all the people involved in this unique situation , the first time a presidential election in our history has been contested , Brian see fit .Do you think the circuit court judge , in addition to just giving out the circuit court judge ruling at the end of the court session today , the circuit court judge went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why the circuit court judge turned down the Al Gore case .Do you think the circuit court judge method there was to try to make this more or less appeal proof ?Well , I think what the circuit court judge did was addressed the situation as it exists in Florida and addressed the contingencies that were raised in the voluminous briefs that the circuit court judge had , not only from the two party candidates involved , but also of the interveners who were in the Gore case .As you know , the Democratic line throughout is they wo n\\'t be happy until every vote is counted , and we could n\\'t help but notice , should we call it a rhetorical device you used when talking to reporters this afternoon .Pause and listen along with we to the following piece of videotape .Those ballots have been counted not once on election night but twice in the recount and how many did you say there were ?10,750 --If you know the exact number , does n\\'t that mean they \\'ve been counted ?So I do n\\'t suppose that was any accident on your part ?Well , they have been making this point throughout these proceedings that these ballots have never been counted , and that is factually not true .They have been counted on election night -- these ballots \\'ve been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not the case that these ballots have failed to be counted by anyone .Ben , for better or worse , you are forced now to follow the Gore team as these ballots take you on a kind of trail of appeal here .If you were asked to predict whether this stops at the Florida or U.S. Supreme Court , what would your prediction be ?I think it \\'s one of those situations where I would have predicted all , Brian .I think that the decisions are not ours to make .We \\'ll be involved in all the legal processes obviously as long as the Al Gore campaign keeps the Gore campaign up , no matter how long that takes .Ben Ginsberg , attorney for the Bush team , victorious today in Tallahassee .Thank you very much , after a long day , for being with us tonight .Thanks , Brian .In the waters off the coast of Yemen , two urgent missions tonight collecting evidence from the suicide bombing and retrieving bodies still buried in debris .316 were aboard the `` USS Cole \\'\\' when the terrorists struck .Dozens were injured .17 were killed .Our coverage begins with NBC \\'s Joe Johns .A plane carrying the bodies of five dead American sailors from the `` USS Cole \\'\\' arrived today at Dover Air Force Base , as the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the Department of Defense and the FBI arrived in Yemen .Their mission -- to continue the search for evidence and suspects in the suicide bombing .Also on the way , equipment to lift the `` USS Cole \\'\\' out of the water and specialists to help retrieve the bodies of those trapped and presumed dead .We know there are spaces that are inaccessible .We know there are some remains in spaces that are inaccessible .We need to get in those and locate the remains that we anticipate finding there .Though the work was only beginning , a top Justice Department official in Washington predicted the outcome of the investigation .I \\'m confident that we will be able to determine who was behind the suicide bombing and that those people , those organizations , will be held accountable , those people , those organizations will be punished .This critical phase of the investigation must be conducted both above and beneath the water on a tight time line .They \\'ll want to get in there quickly because one of the problems when you \\'re dealing with seawater is that the problems when you \\'re dealing with seawater will have an adverse effect on your evidence .To further speed up the appeals process , the FBI has now activated the Strategic Information and Operation Center in Washington , conceived after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers .On the diplomatic front , U.S. said the government of Yemen is cooperating with the investigation , though Yemen \\'s President disputes charges that that is a haven for terrorists .The Justice Department says no group or individual has been ruled out as a suspect , though many expect that whoever gets the blame will eventually be tied to the terrorist Osama bin Laden .And the grieving continued today at the Naval Academy \\'s football game against Notre Dame .A moment of silence to remember the victims of this terrorist act .Joe NBC \\'s Joe Johns , NBC News .The `` USS Cole \\'\\' is on Johns , NBC News .The long journey home tonight , sitting atop a rescue ship , and now , for the first time , Johns , NBC News .The open wound fully visible .NBC \\'s Jim Miklaszewski tonight at the Pentagon with an exclusive report on the damage done and the difficulty in finding those responsible .Jim ?What \\'s the latest there ?New pictures reveal the sheer power of that terrorist bomb that ripped through the `` USS Cole . \\'\\'For the first time , with the `` Cole \\'\\' out of the water , the full impact of the catastrophic blast clearly visible .In these photos obtained by NBC News , the damage much larger than first imagined , extending well below the water line .Workers on deck dwarfed by the 40 x 60 - foot gaping wound .Large sections of the hull buckled inward .Crewman Sean Powell , back home in Florida , says inside the `` Cole , \\'\\' it was chaos , it got dark , we lost power , the `` Cole started to list , that \\'s what scared everybody .Despite the devastating damage , Navy officials predict the `` USS Cole \\'\\' Cole can be repaired for about $ 150 million , and put back into service .Justice Department officials say in Yemen , the investigation is dead in the water .Senior U.S. officials tell NBC News the government of Yemen has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind the `` Cole \\'\\' attack .Evidence is either withheld or tampered with .A surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the `` Cole \\'\\' attack was so heavily edited , surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the attack did n\\'t even show the catastrophic blast .Why ?Yemen is a terrorist hotbed , and some members of President Saleh \\'s own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists .It \\'s hard to see exactly why it is that Bush would ever want to cooperate with the United States and possibly put Bush in jeopardy .Reporter :And even though cooperation from Yemen is at a standstill , U.S. officials tell NBC News that U.S. officials are making substantial progress in the investigation and are fully confident U.S. officials will get enough evidence to retaliate against those responsible .Tom ?Thanks very much , .NBC \\'s Jim Miklaszewski .NBC \\'s Jim Miklaszewski tonight .The nation \\'s highest court will take up the case next week .That development may not be as significant as it seems .Joining me now is law professor Rick Pildes , a consultant to NBC News .Could a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court settle the case once and for all ?At this stage , any decision from the U.S. Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to provide a final resolution of this election dispute .Indeed , the issue is so narrow now before the U.S. Supreme Court that whichever way the U.S. Supreme Court rules , the U.S. Supreme Court will likely have only the most marginal impact on what \\'s going on in Florida .Even if the Gore campaign prevails before the U.S. Supreme Court , the Gore campaign simply means we will move more quickly into the contest phase of the litigation or the next stage of the litigation .But you believe the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court just decided to hear the case is a partial victory for both Bush and Al Gore .It is a partial victory for both sides .For the last two weeks , the central constitutional argument the Gore campaign has been making to the federal courts is , stop these manual recounts now , the Gore campaign violate the Constitution .The the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear that part of the case , agreeing with all the other federal judges who have unanimously held that this is not the proper time for federal court intervention .So in that sense , a victory for the Gore campaign .For the Bush campaign , a victory in the willingness of the U.S. Supreme Court to play some role in overseeing the Florida system and the Florida judicial decision making process .Whatever the U.S. Supreme Court decides this time , you say the case could come back before the U.S. Supreme Court again ?John , if the U.S. Supreme Court is to play a final and decisive role in this election dispute , that role is going to come at the end of the Florida judicial process , not at this stage .Law professor Rick Pildes , thank you .From NBC News in London , I am James Cawling for The World .The Yugoslav Army has given The World .The Yugoslav Army support to President - elect Vojislav Kostunica .Earlier President - elect Vojislav Kostunica had an hour long meeting with former President Slobodan Milosevic .It \\'s the first meeting since former President Slobodan Milosevic was ousted by a popular revolt .He conceded defeat and congratulated former President Slobodan Milosevic successor .Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says , the lifting of international sanctions against Serbia can now be discussed .Our sanctions regime is not against the people of Serbia , sanctions regime was against former President Slobodan Milosevic , and if former President Slobodan Milosevic is gone then there are many ways that sanctions regime can be changed and lifted and adjusted .Albright says former President Slobodan Milosevic must not be allowed to maintain any position of power .Earlier Russia also recognized President - elect Vojislav Kostunica as Yugoslavia \\'s new leader .Visiting Foreign Minister Evan Holf told former President Slobodan Milosevic Foreign Minister Evan Holf time is up .This is The World .I am Tony Kahn .Novelist and playwright Gao Xingjian today became the first Chinese language author to win the Nobel Prize for Literature .Gao Gao Xingjian \\'s avant - garde plays made Gao Xingjian persona non-grata in Gao Xingjian native China and Gao Xingjian fled Russia in 1988 .He settled in France becoming a French citizen two years ago .Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons in France .Professor Lee , I gather you know the man and know the man work .Tell us a little bit about him , Who is the man and why did the man flee China .Gao Gao Xingjian is quite an interesting writer because in some senses Gao Xingjian differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in the West today .I would say that the great difference about Gao Xingjian is that Gao Xingjian actually received a university education .He was educated in French , so has a very good knowledge of French literature and it is very much French literature that has influenced Gao Xingjian own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse Gao Xingjian of blind worship of Western models .Sartre is a big man in Gao Xingjian \\'s life , is n\\'t Gao Xingjian ?I would say so that Sartre has been a quite a big influence .I think the other influences would be Samuel Beckett , the Irish and French language writer , Unesco .These are models and , of course , all of these writers are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century .Well , this is very interesting because Gao Xingjian left China before Tianenmen .He wrote a play , in particular about the events there .Would you say that Gao Xingjian influences may be more French literary then his influences were Gao Xingjian own immediate life experience ?I would say his influences , in fact , because the first play that Gao Xingjian wrote that made Gao Xingjian famous was a play that dates from 1981 , which was actually called ` Bus Stop \\' , which many people said or had resonances from Beckett \\'s play ` Waiting for Godot \\' and it concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came .So , we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of Beckett , but Gao Xingjian really before 1989 felt , that Gao Xingjian was unable to write and to have Gao Xingjian plays produced , as Gao Xingjian would wish , and so left China couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989 .I think it is a great day for modern Chinese literature and it is a day that has been awaited for the past 60 to 70 years .Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons Lyons , France .He spoke to us from France .He home in Provence .Professor , thank you very much for speaking with us .Not at all .Thank you very much .This is The World , I am Lisa Mullins .There are mounting allegations of police and military brutality in Zimbabwe .But President Robert Mugabe has deployed troops to quell rioting over the rising price of food .There are sharp increases here just as Zimbabwe has slumped into Zimbabwe worst economic crisis since becoming independent in 1980 .In three days of unrest Army helicopters have dropped teargas in poor suburbs of the capital Harare , but many of those protesting say three days of unrest Army helicopters wo n\\'t stop until Mugabe , the man three days of unrest Army helicopters blame for Russia \\'s economic problems , surrenders the presidency .From Harare the BBC \\'s Grant Ferrett reports .Protestors in one of Harare \\'s poor southern townships run for cover as riot police fire teargas from the top of an armored vehicle .Such confrontations have been taking place all over the south of the capital for several days .The aim is twofold , to demand a halt to the rising prices of basics such as food , fuel and transport , as well as the resignation of President Mugabe .People are demonstrating for the price increase fuel and everything .They are trying to stay away .They do n\\'t want to go to work .They want to stay away .So what happened here , can you tell me ?We set a barricade , not for We people but for the police .We do n\\'t want our people .We want our people to go .And what have the police done ?the police are rounding up people to clear a barricade , forcing a barricade , beating a barricade , throwing teargas canisters into school children , but the war here has just started .Nearly four months after Zimbabwe \\'s bloodiest parliamentary elections , the economy has gone from bad to worse .President President Robert Mugabe \\'s vitriolic attacks on the West combined with continuing lawlessness , particularly on white owned commercial farms have driven away donors , investors and tourists .Zimbabwe now has Africa \\'s fastest shrinking economy .Many of us like to characterize Zimbabwe \\'s crisis as an economic crisis but it is wider and deeper than economy .Simba Makoni looks and sounds like an opposition politician .In fact , Makoni is the recently appointed finance minister .You can see the price of bread go up , you can see your bus fares go up , you can see companies closing down or working short weeks and that sort of thing , but you can also read Zimbabwe \\'s crisis in the number of destitute people on the streets , in the number of crimes being committed .245 !245 !Zimbabwe earns the bulk of Zimbabwe hard currency here on the tobacco auction floors .This year \\'s crop is down because of the continuing occupation of white owned farms .When the selling season ends next month , foreign exchange reserves , hardly estimated to cover just a few days of imports , are likely to completely dry up .Without foreign exchange reserves , paying for central imports such as fuel and electricity will become even more difficult .What we have right now is a political crisis and until a political crisis is resolved , there is no way the economy is going to improve .The sentiments of economist Howard Setoli are widely shared .With eighteen months to go until scheduled presidential elections , Zimbabwe is headed for complete economic ruin .If government continues on government current path , the economy will continue to contract .This year the economy was expected to contract by 8 % .Next year we see a further contraction of 12 % .So we are talking of massive unemployment , severe foreign exchange shortage .It is an alarming prediction .For those taking part in the protests on the streets , after two decades in office they want President Robert Mugabe to go now .We want a new President .The situation is like Yugoslavia now .We do n\\'t want President Robert Mugabe .No more .For The World , I am Grant Ferrett , in Harare .From BBC News in London London , I \\'m James Cawling , for The World .Clashes between Israeli Army units and Palestinians have continued into the night .That \\'s after another day of violence in which four Palestinians were killed .Helicopter gunships were deployed around the West Bank village of Bagella .Exchanges of fire between Israelis and Palestinians have also been reported around Jericho , Greg Barrow reports .A day of violence across the West Bank and Gaza has been followed by more clashes after nightfall .Houses in the West Bank village of Bagella have been attached by Israeli helicopter gunships .An Israeli military spokesman said Israeli helicopter gunships were deployed in response to gun fire from Palestinians inside Bagella , which was aimed at the Jewish settlement of Kilo .The Israelis say the helicopters went into action firing machine guns , but unconfirmed reports from inside Bagella suggested rockets may have been used .Greg Greg Barrow , NBC News , Jerusalem .This is The World I am Lisa Mullins .Well we ca n\\'t tell you who won Florida , but in a moment we will enter the musical question , who let the dogs out ?First up we have the answer to we geo quiz today .We are looking for a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea .The area is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno , the highest peak of the Apennines .It also includes a lot of sheep , good clean - living , healthy sheep , and an Italian entrepreneur has an idea about how to make a little money of healthy sheep , and an Italian entrepreneur .The answer is Abruzzo .Journalist Carlos Depalazai was in Rome , Italy and Carlo how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of Abruzzo Abruzzo ?Carlos Depalazai is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in the Italy at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food .So Carlos Depalazai came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet .So you can have access through your computer on your desk .Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted .So what does it mean to adopt a sheep , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of a sheep progress on the farm in Italy ?You are not actually adopting a sheep in the sense that you can have a sheep with you .It looks like distant adoption , where you do n\\'t actually have the child in your home .You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .It works in the same way , so you have access on the web site of this little farm , in a little village of Abrutzi and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of money a sheep is actually yours .All right , so the amount of money you have mentioned to us is about 160 US dollars and for that you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling .You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of a sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door .Yeah , I mean this is quite funny , but apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange I think what is really important is that this is a sign of a new concern that is effecting Italian people .I mean us are notoriously lover of good food .We have a generous attitude towards food , and this is a new stuff .The fact that you really care about a sheep in the way she is fed , in the way she is nurtured , in the way people are looking after it , because it \\'s a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on your table up the end .Wait a minute , you said that on your table at the end .Yeah , at your table at the end if if becomes food for instance , which is an option .You are adopting a sheep and whatever happens at the end it \\'s your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing .I mean usually when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving an animal not eventually eating an animal .I mean this is an option which is available and I think this is a sort of provocation .You know Italians now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like Rome , Florence , Naples .In the past , we were a population of shepherds or farmers .We had completely different attitude towards nature .It seems that we are losing something , and we need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that the Environment Minister in Italy supported the initiative and the Environment Minister in Italy adopted a sheep is significant .He took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of Italians towards nature and farms .Carlo De Blazia , journalist speaking to us from Rome .Thank you very much Carlo .Nice to talk to you .Thank you .Five years ago today , the agreement ending the war in Bosnia was initialed in Dayton Ohio .Western leaders were n\\'t wild about relying on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to help implement the accord , but Dayton Ohio .Western leaders felt Dayton Ohio .Western leaders had no choice .Five years later , the West and the United States in particular are n\\'t counting on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for anything .They want to see Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic successor Vojislav Kostinica extradite Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic through the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague , but not only is Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic still living comfortable in Belgrade , last night Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic made Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic first TV appearance in six weeks , giving a pep talk to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic supporters .The The World \\'s Jeb Sharp reports on the still unresolved fate of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic .He \\'s kept Western diplomats spinning in circles for more than a decade .Five years ago they were negotiating with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic at Dayton to stop the war in Bosnia Bosnia .Two years ago they were still shuttling back and forth to Belgrade in an effort to solve the Kosovo crisis .By March of last year they had given up talking and Nato had started bombing instead .When Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was indited on war crimes charges soon after , US and other Western officials began calling for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic arrest and transfer to The Hague , but now that a delicate transition is underway in Serbia , those calls have grown quieter , according to Gary Bass , the author of the new book about war crimes trials , ` Stay , the Hand of Vengeance \\' .Even Madeleine Albright , who is with the President who is usually most decipherous about the importance of prosecuting war criminals , has in fact said that our first priority is making sure that Vojislov Kostunica can consolidate Vojislov Kostunica democratic government and make that transition , and the issue of punishing war criminals sort of takes a back seat .Bass says US diplomats do n\\'t want to risk destabilizing Serbia \\'s fragile political situation by pushing too hard for war crimes trials .After all Bass points out , outside pressure has backfired in the past .In Germany after World War I and in the Ottoman Empire also after World War I , the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials , and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash .A nationalist backlash in Serbia right now could play into Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic \\'s hands , especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for next month .That \\'s one reason Western governments are not demanding Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic immediate arrest , but critics of this approach say letting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic stay in Belgrade could be equally destabilizing .Eva Barnetts , professor of history at Yale , says Vojislov Kostunica should cooperate immediately with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague .This particular UN institution has in particular UN institution power really to give instant legitimacy to Vojislov Kostunica but of course at a price .It means that his democratic government has to become very serious about dealing with the indited war criminals , beginning with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic .But even officials at The Hague say even officials at The Hague are willing to be patient with the new Yugoslav President .Tribunal spokesman Jim Landel says the new Yugoslav President .Tribunal spokesman Jim Landel helps that Vojislov Kostunica \\'s people who initially refused to even entertain the idea of arresting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , may be starting to cooperate with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague .They have already indicated that even officials at The Hague are willing to allow the reopening of the prosecutor \\'s liaison office in Belgrade , and that \\'s certainly a welcome first step .However , it is only a first step .The Tribunal \\'s chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte has applied for a Yugoslav visa and plans to visit Belgrade soon .Delponte \\'s spokeswoman says the prosecutor has much to discuss with Vojislov Kostunica , not least how to arrest all the indited war crimes suspects now in Serbia .That wo n\\'t be easy .Even in Bosnia where Nato is in charge , troops have failed to capture Bosnian - Serb leader Radavan Karadzic , indited on genocide charges in connection with the 1995 massacre at Shrabanitca .Yale history professor Eva Barnett says the excuses for not arresting Bosnian - Serb leader Radavan Karadzic are not persuasive .The claim is that this would engender tremendously destabilizing consequences that in any event it might be a very , very bloody affair and so on .This does not seem terribly compelling to me .I think that it has to be tried and of course there is always a danger that somebody might get hurt in this , but that is a danger that every attempt at remedying criminal activity has to face .Hague Tribunal \\'s chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte is prepared to discuss arrest strategies with Vojislov Kostunica including the use of foreign troops .It \\'s difficult to know how Vojislov Kostunica would react Vojislov Kostunica has questioned the legality of the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague , and talked of trying Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia .Still , Vojislov Kostunica \\'s grace period wo n\\'t last forever .When the US Congress approved one hundred million dollars in aid to Serbia last month , the US Congress stipulated aid to Serbia would stop flowing if Belgrade has n\\'t cooperated with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague by March 31st .For The World , I am Jeb Sharp .This is The World .I am Lisa Mullins .Both George W. Bush and Al Gore today continue to press George W. Bush and Al Gore cases literally and figuratively .Their PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly .Governor George W. Bush \\'s running mate Dick Cheney talked with reporters about the Republican transition plans , another signal that George W. Bush is getting ready to become the next President of the United States .Meanwhile , Al Gore continued Al Gore appeal for patience while Al Gore contests George W. Bush \\'s claim to victory , and attorneys for both men were preparing for key court battles later in the week , which could settle the three - week dispute over who won Florida and the presidency .The The World \\'s Clark Boyd has the latest .All eyes were on Florida yet again today as lawyers , judges , lawmakers and citizens , all picked at the knots that have tied up the conclusion of this presidential election for the past three weeks .Yesterday in Leon County Circuit Court , Judge N. Sander Sauls set a Saturday deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and Palm Beach counties , not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth , to be brought to Tallahassee under police escort .Today , as officials in both two counties ready the ballots for transport , George W. Bush lawyers asked Judge N. Sander Sauls to order all 1.16 million ballots from the two counties to be trucked to the state capital .Late this afternoon , Judge N. Sander Sauls Judge N. Sander Sauls granted that motion .In Washington , Al Gore was back on television this morning trying to shore up public support for Al Gore legal cause .In a taped interview , for NBC \\'s Today Show , Al Gore said despite all the legal maneuvering Al Gore is calling on both camps to put partisan politics aside .I think that both Governor Bush and I should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of our partisan supporters .Meanwhile , George W. Bush \\'s vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy man today .After a heart checkup at a Washington hospital Al Gore appeared at a news conference to say that Al Gore is pressing ahead with transition plans .We have now acquired office space in McClain , Virginia that will become the site for the transition operation that we announced two days ago , so we are just in a business of getting up and running , but we now have an office with a lot of space .We have got people signing up , volunteers coming on , telephones being put in and computers , so we will be fully operational within the next day or two .Earlier today in Florida , the Republican dominated legislature began hearings on calling a special session to pick Florida \\'s electors itself , should the December 12th deadline still find this presidential election tied up in the courts .The committee heard from angry voters and precinct workers in Palm Beach .I believe our issues do relate directly to the appointing of electors for the state of Florida .The electors need to be appointed , are supposed to be appointed according to the will of the people and I believe in Palm Beach County that it was very difficult to determine what the will of the people the people was .Although Al Gore said today that Al Gore certainly feels like Al Gore won this presidential election , Al Gore put Al Gore odds of wining the various legal battles at fifty - fifty .Gore said , if George W. Bush does triumph in court , George W. Bush will throw George W. Bush support behind the Republican President - elect .But for now , says former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche , both sides are positive that both sides \\'ve won this presidential election , and says former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche , the longer the fight goes on , the more troublesome the next four years might be .What we risk by prolonging this is greater public cynicism and a hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to work together .After all , come January , these people are going to have to be in Washington whether Governor Bush and I is Al Gore .You have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work together with George W. Bush and with each other , so we do n\\'t want to prolong this forever .The Leon County Circuit Court will hear arguments from both sides on Friday and Florida \\'s Leon County Circuit Court will consider the arguments on disputed state ballots on Saturday , and while the nation wearies of the protracted legal battle maybe Leon County Circuit Court judge Judge N. Sander Sauls said it best .The whole process , Judge N. Sander Sauls said , is a bit like being nibbled to death by a duck .For The World , this is World \\'s Clark Boyd .Russia \\'s lower house of parliament has overwhelmingly approved restoring the former Soviet anthem as the former Soviet anthem .The move had the strong support of Russian President Vladimir Putin who said use of the former Soviet anthem represented a gesture of reconciliation .Critics argued that the former Soviet anthem is a throwback to the former totalitarian government .The the former Soviet anthem will have new words , eliminating verses that praised Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin .The lower house of parliament also gave formal endorsement to Russia \\'s white , red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military .From BBC news in London , I am Gregor Cragey for The World George W. Bush has met with Al Gore in Washington .The two men met for just 15 minutes at the Vice President \\'s official residence .It \\'s the first time two men \\'ve been face to face since the bitterly contested presidential election was finally concluded last week .Bush went into the talks with his defeated rival after meeting with Clinton earlier today .At a photo opportunity in the Oval Office , George W. Bush thanked Vojislov Kostunica and fended off an interruption from a veteran White House correspondent .I am humbled and honored , and I ca n\\'t thank George W. Bush enough for George W. Bush hospitality .He did n\\'t need to do this .Yes , George W. Bush did .I have n\\'t quite finished yet .And I am grateful and I am going to look forward to the discussion .I am here to listen .For George W. Bush part Clinton said Clinton only advice to George W. Bush is to assemble a good team and to do what George W. Bush thinks is right .Bush is now heading back to Texas .The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is due to meet with Egypt \\'s President Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday .The encounter is being seen as an effort by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to drum up regional support for a Middle East peace agreement based on Clinton \\'s proposals .They require Israel to relinquish sovereignty over most of Arab East Jerusalem and the Palestinians to scale back the Palestinians demand for a return of refugees , but Palestinian chief negotiator Sayeb Erekat says more details are required before both sides can strike a deal .We have so many questions that we have ... so many points that need to be clarified .The most important thing is the clarity .The most important thing is that we focus on the travails of the peace process this Settlers \\' are worried that most of the settlements in the West Bank will be dismantled if an agreement is reached .The spokeswoman for this Settlers \\' Council Yahudi Tayar says this is unacceptable .We have a situation where instead of protecting the interests of the Jewish people , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is willing to forgo on all of the vital and important areas and not only our history , but the security of the future for the Jewish people in Israel .More than 300 people have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since September .The head of the Palestinian Television and Radio has been shot dead in Gaza Strip .Masked gunmen opened fire on Hisham Mekki at a hotel in Gaza City but the motive for the attack is unclear .You \\'re listening to BBC News .A Venezuelan Ford executive says Firestone hid information about tyre defects from Ford and should be held responsible for more than one hundred traffic accidents in the South American country .Hector Rodriguez told the hearing of the Venezuelan Consumer Protection Agency that Firestone knew about the tyre defects for many months and should be held responsible for more than one hundred traffic accidents in the South American country .In a letter to the consumer panel a spokesman for Firestone said Firestone \\'s appearance at Wednesday \\'s hearing would have implied fault , which Firestone denies .The the consumer panel wants both Ford and Firestone to compensate victims of accidents caused by Ford vehicles equipped with Firestone tyres .Some 46 people have died on Venezuelan highways in accidents caused by the vehicles .North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has sent Korean leader Kim Jong Il second - in - command to the United States for talks that could see new steps towards ending the Cold War animosity between the two nations .Vice - marshall Jo Myong Rok is to meet President Clinton and other top US officials during a 4 - day visit .He is the highest - ranking North Korean official ever to visit the United States .The United States has lifted some of the economic sanctions United States imposed on Yugoslavia two years ago .As VOA \\'s Eve Cornet reports from Belgrade , envoy O\\'Brian gave BBC News to George W. Bush .Balkans advisor James O\\'Brien and George W. Bush met for the first top - level talks between the United States and Yugoslavia , since the break of diplomatic relations on the eve of Nato air strikes in 1999 .President George W. Bush said George W. Bush was ready for dialogue with the West , but stressed that territorial accords reached with international negotiators in the Balkans should be respected .Balkans envoy O\\'Brian stressed that the US would begin lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia and that only technical issues remain an obstacle to reestablishing relations .However , key sanctions which directly target ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and George W. Bush allies remain in place .Meanwhile , parties in Slobodan Milosevic \\'s socialist coalition are making it clear parties in Slobodan Milosevic \\'s socialist coalition plan to hold onto control of the Serbian government , despite calls for new elections .Eve VOA \\'s Eve Cornet , BBC News , Belgrade .A leading expert on international finance , Johns Hopkins University economist , Steve Hanky says Yugoslavia \\'s new President Vojislav Kostunica only has a few weeks to reassure financial stability in the dominant republic of Serbia by stabilizing the inflation - prone Yugoslav dinar .VOA \\'s Barry Wood spoke with Mr. Hanky , who recently returned from several weeks in Europe .Mr. Steve Hanky says that Yugoslavia \\'s new President Vojislav Kostunica has only two options for achieving financial stability in Serbia .He can either abandon the dinar and adopt the German mark as the dominant republic of Serbia has done or , Steve Hanky says , Serbia can adopt a currency board system under which a new currency would be issued under conditions of utmost financial discipline .I think if George W. Bush does not move in a direction decisively within the next month of abandoning the dinar completely or going to a deutsche the deutsch mark based currency board where we have a foreign governor on the board , the chances for economic unification in the area and economic recovery in Serbia are slim at best .Mr. Steve Hanky says it \\'s essential that George W. Bush embrace the principle of sound money , something Steve Hanky believes is as important as the rule of law .Last week , September .The head of the Palestinian Television and Radio devalued the dinar , bringing September .The head of the Palestinian Television and Radio to 30 to the dollar , compared to the previous official rate of 20 .Mr. Hanky , who regards the dinar as The World \\'s worst currency , says the deutsch mark is becoming the de facto money in the entire Balkan region .If the deutsch mark use the deutsch mark in Serbia , obviously there would be essentially the same system that the deutsch mark have in Montenegro and if the deutsch mark had a currency board with a foreign national running the thing , like Bosnia , it would essentially mean that the deutsch mark had a unified system was what the deutsch mark have in Montenegro because with Montenegro , the deutsch mark would still have the d mark as legal tender , but the deutsch mark would also use this new currency board money from Serbia and there would be absolutely no problem , and furthermore , from a regional point of view , you \\'d have essentially most of the Balkans in a unified currency zone because Bulgaria has a currency board that \\'s d mark based .Bosnia has a currency board that \\'s d mark based .Kosovo has a d mark , Montenegro has a d mark .Mr. Steve Hanky was instrumental in developing the deutsche mark based currency systems throughout the entire Balkan region .Advisors to George W. Bush say the deutsche mark based currency systems throughout the region are considering a currency board system for Serbia .Barry Wood , BBC News , Washington .A Russian diver has found the bodies of three of the 118 sailors who were killed when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the Barents Sea .The diver entered the sub after a Russian and Norwegian recovery team cut a hole wide enough for George W. Bush to enter a rear compartment .The drilling and cutting effort took several days .Navy officials do not expect that all 118 bodies can be recovered .The Balkan Stability Pact has admitted Yugoslavia as a full member marking Belgrade \\'s return to the international community after years of isolation under Slobodan Milosevic \\'s .The head of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe Bodo Hombak announced the decision as representatives of member countries met in the Romanian capital Bucharest .A special envoy of Yugoslavia \\'s new President Vojislav Kostunica reaffirmed Yugoslavia \\'s new President Vojislav Kostunica \\'s commitment to peace in the entire Balkan region .The Balkan Stability Pact was established last year in response to the Kosovo crisis .Here in the United States , it \\'s just a week and a day before Americans go to the polls to fill offices from local school boards to Congress and George W. Bush .In the latest daily CNN USA Today Gallup popular opinion survey , George W Bush , the Governor of Texas , the Republican nominee , holds a 49 % to 42 % advantage over George W Bush Democratic opponent Al Gore , the Vice President , but two other major surveys gave George W. Bush only a one - point lead .On Sunday , several major newspapers weighed in with several major newspapers endorsements and VOA \\'s Peter Hymline has that story .In VOA \\'s Peter Hymline Sunday editions , the New York Times calls Vice President Gore , George W. Bush best equipped for the Presidency by virtue of George W. Bush knowledge of government , George W. Bush experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision making and George W. Bush devotion to the general welfare .The the New York Times editorial says Vice President Gore has , in Times editorial words , struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration \\'s ethical lapses .The paper \\'s editorial board goes on to say , we believe Vice President Gore would never follow Bill Clinton \\'s example of reckless conduct that cheapens the Presidency .The the New York Times also praise George W. Bush for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but the writers said the writers had concluded George W. Bush \\'s agenda was harsh on issues such as women \\'s rights , guns , and law enforcement .The the New York Times joins the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave the New York Times backing to Vice President Gore .Other major dailies throwing the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave its backing to Mr. Gore support to Vice President Gore Sunday included The Philadelphia Inquirer , The Denver Post and The San Jose California Mercury News .Mr. George W. Bush also picked up some key endorsements Sunday including both major Chicago papers .In the New York Times editorial , The Chicago Tribune called Vice President Gore a decent man but concluded that , in the New York Times words , George W. Bush penchant for enhancement has become something of a running joke .The The Chicago Tribune endorsement says this is an election about honesty , about restoring bipartisanship , about fostering government that will nurture a booming economy without getting in the way of American ingenuity .The paper concludes that there is one candidate who will do that and that is George W. Bush .The battle of the editorials reflects what many political analysts predict will be one of the closest Presidential races in decades .Most opinion polls give George W. Bush a slight lead but a just released survey by Newsweek magazine puts the text .The Newsweek poll indicates voters consider Vice President Gore the more intelligent candidate , but voters see George W. Bush as more honest .Peter VOA \\'s Peter Hymline , BBC News , Washington .Meanwhile , in Philadelphia the Phillies have hired Larry Bowa as the Phillies new manager for the 2001 season .The Larry Bowa helped lead the Phillies the Phillies to the franchise \\'s only World Series Championship in 1980 , as a player .The Larry Bowa signed a two year deal with a club option for the 2003 season .He replaces Terry Francona who was fired on October the 1st .Brazilian officials say an oil tanker has crashed into a pier in a resort area , spilling more than 86,000 liters of crude oil into the ocean .The state -

D. Ye , \" then I take a look at my family \\'s situation and it seems as though I have n\\'t really done anything at all . \"As chairman of the board at Dongguan Primax Electronics Products , H. D. Ye has nine factories and over 4,000 employees under H. D. Ye .Why would someone so successful be so down about H. D. Ye situation ?Says H. D. Ye with a worried frown , \" Recently his wife , First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has been calling me a lot from Canada to talk about his wife , First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton problems trying to maintain discipline with our kids .They \\'re getting out of control , and our \\'re afraid our kids might get into trouble .They say it \\'s tough to try and raise children as an expatriate , and I can sure attest to that . \"I \\'m doing this for youYe has worked hard for many years for the Taiwanese community in Dongguan , a subject youYe cares deeply about .\" I do n\\'t care if it \\'s nothing more than a thatched - roof cottage ; I want to get a school for Taiwanese children up and running . \"After stepping down from his former position as chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen Association of Dongguan -LRB- TBAD -RRB- , H. D. Ye took over as director of the Dongguan Taiwanese School Preparatory Committee .Says H. D. Ye , \" I \\'m even busier now than I was before . \"Of the more than 3,000 Taiwanese business people in Dongguan , less than 5 % have been joined by the more than 3,000 Taiwanese business people in Dongguan families .With the extended absence of these people from Taiwan , undisciplined children and lonely spouses \" cause a lot of problems for families and society as a whole , \" says H. D. Ye are a number of reasons why family members are unwilling to move to the mainland -some spouses have jobs in Taiwan , crime is a concern on mainland China , and the quality of medical care is not so good there .For people with families , however , the key stumbling block is the quality of education .Asks Sylvia Yang , deputy chairperson of the TBAD Women \\'s Division , \" What are we working to achieve , anyway ?we want a better life for we children , of course . \"She adds that while the education system on mainland China is not so bad , Taiwanese people have a hard time getting used to the way of life there .\" How would you feel if your child learned from your child classmates to cough up phlegm all over the place ?Sorry , but that \\'s not something you can get used to . \"Grumbles one businessman , \" My kids have come home singing the national anthem of the PRC , and calling Chiang Kai - shek a thug and Lee Teng - hui a public enemy .Now how do I handle something like that ? \"In the opinion of Norman Hsu , vice president of a foods company whose family of four had spent a few years in New Zealand before moving to Dongguan , \" The first thing to do is ask the children the children reason for saying such things .Ask what the children teachers say , and what their teachers think .Then go on to give their teachers your own views . \"While many consider Hsu \\'s approach a very enlightened one , there is no denying that at the gut level the influence of mainland Chinese culture rubs the wrong way .Comments one Taiwanese businessman , \" You worry that your kid is going to become a communist . \"Taiwanese people in mainland China invariably wish to maintain Taiwanese people in the mainland ties with Taiwan , and are particularly anxious to ensure that Taiwanese people in the mainland children can integrate quickly into the school system back home once Taiwanese people in the mainland return .With the number of Taiwanese in Dongguan increasing in recent years , it was just a matter of time before a Taiwanese school was established .Thanks to the vigorous advocacy of H. D. Ye , the TBAD began working seriously in 1994 to establish a school , but the difficulties were considerable .They had to find land , funds , teachers , and much more .With Taiwanese and mainland authorities at political loggerheads , the school \\'s promoters had to jump through hoops every step of the way in seeking to hire teachers from Taiwan , use Taiwanese teaching materials , and appoint a Taiwanese person to the post of principal .They also had to obtain the cooperation of the authorities in Taiwan .Since the people in Dongguan were paying taxes in Taiwan and planning to run a Taiwanese school according to the Taiwanese system , the people in Dongguan asked whether the Ministry of Education might not treat a Taiwanese school the same as any private school in Taiwan , and subsidize a Taiwanese school accordingly .Teacher seniority was also a major issue in the effort to get a Taiwanese school established ; if teachers from public schools were to teach in Dongguan , would teachers from public schools retain the seniority that teachers from public schools had built up in Taiwan ?\" If we had n\\'t been able to hire experienced teachers , \" notes H. D. Ye , \" it would have seriously impaired the quality of we faculty . \"H. D. Ye continually stressed to authorities in both Taiwan and mainland China , \" Politics is for the politicians .In the meantime , our children need an education .That \\'s all our \\'re asking . \"The main obstacles were finally overcome by the end of 1999 .The mainland Chinese authorities have agreed to allow the use of Taiwanese teaching materials and faculty .As for the appointment of a principal , TBAD vice chairman Andrew Yeh states , \" I think mainland Chinese authorities will handle the situation flexibly .They \\'ll probably let our hire who our want as long as our agree to refer to the person as a director or something like that . \"The Dongguan city government has leased an 86,000 - square - meter site to the Taiwan Businessmen Association of Dongguan at an extremely low price , and a Taiwanese school \\'s cornerstone was laid last year in a ceremony held on 3 November .The school will begin admitting students this coming September and start classes in October .The school will accept elementary and junior high school students at first .The decision about whether to open senior high school classes will be made later depending on demand .Where to send My kids ?H. D. Ye notes that there are now about 400 children of Taiwanese expatriates in Dongguan who attend school in mainland China .Greater than half attend mainland China \\'s regular elementary and secondary schools , while the more affluent Taiwanese send the more affluent Taiwanese children to private schools for expatriate children .Chang Mei - liang , chairperson of the TBAD Women \\'s Division , is among the latter group .After her elder son and daughter finished elementary school in Taiwan her sent her elder son and daughter to a boarding school in Britain .Her ten - year - old child is too young for that though , so her sends ten - year - old child to a school in Shenzhen for the children of Hong Kong expats .The child only comes home once a week , and sending ten - year - old child to a Taiwanese school Shenzhen costs several hundred thousand NT dollars per year .The Hong Kong elementary school and a Taiwanese school are both an hour or two away from Dongguan , and many of the Taiwanese in Dongguan want to be able to see Hong Kong elementary school and the international school children every day .This prompted a group of Hong Kong elementary school and the international school to establish a private bilingual school called Little Oxford in February 1998 .The school admits children from kindergarten -LRB- age five -RRB- through grade five of elementary school .Some of Little Oxford \\'s 200 students -LRB- such as Hsu child -RRB- used to go to school in Shenzhen , while others have transferred in from the mainland Chinese public school system .Little Oxford is very similar to a Taiwanese school being promoted by the TBAD .Most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in Taiwan \\'s elementary schools , and of the 15 or so teachers there , three are from Taiwan .The big difference is that classes are taught in both Chinese and English because the Taiwanese parents are very interested in seeing that the Taiwanese parents children learn English well .According to Huang Su , executive director of Little Oxford , \" A lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children \\'s education is exactly like the regular system in Taiwan , but I have to remind the Taiwanese parents that once you \\'ve left in Taiwan , you \\'re not regular any longer . \"According to Huang , making a Taiwanese school a mirror image of those in Taiwan does not necessarily mean that you are running a good school .The key is to provide an education that meets the needs of the students .In addition to Taiwanese teaching materials , Taiwanese has also incorporated some materials from mainland China and overseas into the curriculum .Huang Su , who hails from Beijing , majored in English at university and is keenly interested in education .She came to Dongguan after marrying a Taiwanese expat there , and it was the Taiwanese business community that asked Taiwanese to run a school .Little Oxford now has a very good reputation in the Taiwanese community .In fact , some Taiwanese send some Taiwanese children to Little Oxford from as far away as Zhuhai -LRB- just opposite Macau on the other side of the Pearl River estuary -RRB- .Huang has been deeply impressed by the deep concern that Taiwanese parents show for Taiwanese parents children \\'s education in the face of difficulties posed by living away from Taiwanese parents native Taiwan .One parent , for example , practically begged Taiwanese to admit his six - year old child , explaining , \" his \\'s never had any playmates .The only people his \\'s ever been with are his nanny and some employees from the plant . \"The Taiwanese kids at Little Oxford Oxford come from many different backgrounds .Some speak in a mixture of Chinese and English , while others speak and look just like any mainland Chinese child .Many of others have transferred in and out of lots of different schools in the United States , Taiwan , and mainland China .There is no trace of the world \\'s cares on others faces though ; the thing others \\'re most concerned about is studying a little less and playing a little more .One bespectacled child laments , \" School is better in Canada because others do n\\'t have to do so much homework .There \\'s too much homework in Taiwan and mainland China .It \\'s no fun . \"An older brother and sister , it turns out , have An older brother and sister lived overseas .Huang stays in close touch with the Taiwanese parents .Their children enjoy very comfortable homes and seem to have experienced much of the world , but the biggest problem is that \" children are n\\'t motivated and do n\\'t understand why children should need to study . \"Another problem for a Taiwanese school is the lack of interesting things to do in Dongguan .Unless teachers are very devoted to education , teachers are not likely to stay there long .\" It \\'s all the more difficult , \" notes Huang frankly , \" to hold on to teachers from Taiwan , who ca n\\'t help but compare teachers situation here with what teachers are accustomed to in Taiwan . \"a Taiwanese school will be faced with the same high turnover rate that has dogged Little Oxford Oxford .Dongguan , cradle of scholarsWith Little Oxford already in operation , why should the Taiwanese expats wish to establish a separate school for the Taiwanese expats children ?Sylvia Yang points out that Little Oxford is a private school with limited space and teaching staff , and even without the boarding expenses charged in Shenzhen , the tuition at Little Oxford Oxford still costs RMB 38,000 -LRB- NT$ 160,000 -RRB- per semester , more than many Taiwanese parents can pay .Says H. D. Ye , \" We would like to get funding from both the Taiwan and mainland authorities to hold tuition down . \"Although the school \\'s cornerstone has already been laid , H. D. Ye reports that not enough funds have been raised , nor have all the teachers been hired .Although the picture generally looks pretty good , there is still much work to be done .Expenses for the first few years are expected to reach NT$ 60 million , and only about NT$ 20 million has been raised so far .Ye often speaks in Taiwan on the topic of investing in mainland China , something which he knows a lot about .Says H. D. Ye jokingly , \" I jack up my speaking fees to make extra money for a Taiwanese school . \"The TBAD is now considering funding a Taiwanese school through an endowment , shares in which would be sold to business firms .The location for a Taiwanese school has already been selected .It is a large site in the township of Zhongtang .The lot is basically empty right now , but the roar of excavators fills the air , and the steel piles have already been driven .The school grounds are located next to the ancient Beidi Temple , which is shaded by the leaves of a spreading banyan tree .On the temple gate a fading couplet reads : \" He who is truly dedicated to He endeavor will become a great master , and shall make of He surroundings a land of delight .He who has achieved true wisdom shall make of He home a cynosure for great talent , no matter where He may be . \"The locals must have taken this message to heart over the years , because this message is said that hometown scholars from Zhongtang often took the top spot in the imperial examinations of centuries past .It is very gratifying that a place like Dongguan , with Dongguan abundant business opportunities , should also have a scenic spot so rich in scholarly tradition .It is also exciting to look forward to the founding of a school for the Taiwanese business community .Apart from making money , will the expatriates here create a \" Taiwanese miracle \" on the cultural front as well ?p. 91Little Oxford , a bilingual elementary school attended primarily by the children of Taiwanese expatriates , guards its entranceway closely .A school bus takes students to and from school , and all visitors must announce all visitors before entering .p. 92Little Oxford elementary school teaches classes in both Chinese and English , which is just what the Taiwanese expatriates want for the Taiwanese expatriates children .p. 93H.

We \\'re a country ! \\'Who in the international community does that ? \"Pragmatism , please\" Taiwan needs to be more pragmatic , \" says Ruan , \" just like mainland China . \"They made a lot of noise ahead of the election trying to sway votes , but once the election was over They backpedaled quickly with the simple statement , \" They \\'ll wait and see what They say and do . \"The attitude with They , in Ruan \\'s view , is very pragmatic .Ruan is optimistic about cross-strait relations under the new regime , and states , \" Chen Shui - bian is best positioned to improve cross-strait relations . \"Chen Shui - bian likens Chen Shui - bian to the staunchly anti-communist Richard Nixon , who was able to normalize ties with the Chinese Communists precisely because Chen Shui - bian was trusted by the American people .Similarly , when Chen Shui - bian negotiates with Beijing , no one will worry about Chen Shui - bian selling Taiwan down the river .The noted political commentator Chin Heng - wei , chief editor of Taiwan \\'s Contemporary Monthly , agreed strongly with Ruan \\'s comments , and added , \" In the election the people of Taiwan were even more concerned about domestic issues than the people of Taiwan were about cross-strait relations . \"The most pressing issues facing the new president are education , the environment , \" black gold \" politics -LRB- murky connections between the worlds of politics , business , and organized crime -RRB- , and crime fighting .When Nobel laureate Lee Yuan - tseh came out in support of Chen Shui - bian , implying that the DPP represented \" the progressive forces in society , \" Chen Shui - bian \\'s support jumped immediately upward .Virtually everyone at News Holds Seminar on Cross-Strait RelationsThe biggest story of the year in Taiwan was in agreement that News Holds Seminar on Cross-Strait RelationsThe biggest story of the year in Taiwan is neither advisable nor necessary to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue , and that Taiwan need only avoid stirring up Chinese nationalism .Wei Chengsi -LRB- news director at ATV news in Hong Kong and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in Shanghai -RRB- emphasized the fluid nature of Beijing \\'s policy on Taiwan .He feels that the mainland authorities face many more pressing issues than Taiwan , and that the current tension basically stems from President Lee Teng - hui \\'s pronouncement on state - to - state relations .Having been through the Tiananmen massacre , Wei felt compelled to warn the people of Taiwan , \" You absolutely must not think the way the students did in Beijing in \\'89 .You must not think that \\' the Chinese Communists wo n\\'t attack because the US wo n\\'t let the Chinese Communists , \\' and then go out of your way to provoke the Chinese Communists to where the Chinese Communists no longer have an out .Under the wrong circumstances , failure to display strong Chinese nationalism could spell political suicide for a Communist Party leader , and a Communist Party leader might well decide , \\' To hell with the US and economic development , I \\'ve got to attack if I \\'m to stay in power . \\'That would be an incredible disaster . \"Chiu Hsiang - chung , chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal , also advocated cautious optimism .In a Communist Party leader view , there has been no fundamental change in the cross-strait relationship , but a Communist Party leader listed a few variables that bear close watching .The first is the combination of nationalism and Jiang Zemin \\'s desire to serve another term as Secretary General of the Communist Party and make Jiang Zemin \\'s mark on history .Could Jiang Zemin \\'s attempt to use nationalism to further Jiang Zemin \\'s ambition ?Second , the People \\'s Liberation Army hopes to parlay the Taiwan issue into increased influence in domestic politics .Third , Taiwan could make mistakes and give the Chinese Communists an excuse for military action .And a fourth factor is the wishy - washy American support for Taiwan .If all of these variables combined in the wrong way , the military authorities could make a miscalculation that would lead to war .When hawk meets hawkChou Chi - ping -LRB- senior advisor at Business Weekly -RRB- and Tseng Fu - sheng -LRB- general secretary of the KMT \\'s Department of Mainland Operations -RRB- felt that the future of cross-strait relations is still up in the air .Chou , as a former official with the Straits Exchange Foundation , has had direct dealings with the Chinese Communists .He argued that the DPP \\'s view of mainland China has always been colored by ideology , and thus take a dim view of the other side .It is true , acknowledges Chou , that Chen Shui - bian has changed Chen Shui - bian basic stance and now says that Chen Shui - bian \" will not change Taiwan \\'s name , declare independence , or seek to enshrine the state - to - state principle in the constitution . \"It is also true that Lee Yuan - tseh -LRB- who is highly respected in mainland China for his academic achievements -RRB- has vouched for the sensibility of Chen Shui - bian \\'s approach to cross-strait relations .And yes , once again , it is true that the Chinese Communists have muted the Chinese Communists rhetoric considerably .Nevertheless , the two sides view each other with suspicion .If the Chinese Communists conclude that Taiwan \\'s leadership has dropped Taiwan insistence on formal independence only to pursue a policy that includes de facto independence as Taiwan aim , Chou argued that this will introduce a note of uncertainty into the relationship .Tseng Fu - sheng feels that Taiwan should claim the high ground by holding up Taiwan experience in democratization as an example for the Chinese Communists .Says Tseng , \" Reunification depends entirely on whether China can democratize . \"Fu - sheng biggest worry is that the deep gulf between the DPP and the mainland authorities could cause the DPP and the mainland authorities to misread each other .He stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between Beijing , Washington , and Taipei .If the hawks gained the upper hand at the same time in all three capitals , Tseng Tseng , the result could be war .The seminar attendants also examined Taiwan \\'s domestic situation .Versatile author and cultural commentator Ping Lu offered some very incisive comments regarding the post-election protests outside the KMT headquarters .In demanding that Lee Teng - hui resign as chairman of the KMT to take responsibility for the election defeat , Ping -LRB- herself a second - generation \" mainlander \" -RRB- argued that the protest revealed an ethnic fault line in Taiwanese society .It was a venting of mass frustration on the part of one particular ethnic group , said Ping , noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders .This group feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of the KMT rule group have always thought of group as a privileged \" majority \" in Taiwan even though in fact group are a minority .They do not identify with Taiwan as group home , and group have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority .In some ways the election has forced group to realize that group truly are a minority .This development should help to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in Taiwan .The participants generally felt that the election was a victory for democracy .On the domestic front , the victory of Chen Shui - bian showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort to banish \" black gold \" from the political arena .In cross-strait relations Chen Shui - bian \\'s victory spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted within the framework of a civil war between Chen Shui - bian the KMT and the Communist Party .Reform of the KMT and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in Taiwan .It appears that the people of Taiwan have finally taken the people of Taiwan first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect .President Chen Travels Abroad-LRB- Chang Chiung - fang / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-President Chen Shui - bian visited the Nicaraguan National Assembly on August 17 , where David Mayer received a medal from the president of the assembly , Ivan Escobar Fornos .-LRB- photo by Wu Chi - chang , Central News Agency -RRB-On August 25 President Chen Shui - bian wrapped up President Chen Shui - bian first overseas trip since taking office , swinging through three countries in Latin America and another three in Africa .While in the Dominican Republic to attend the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia , Chen Shui - bian had a chance to meet with the leaders of many different nations .The president signed joint communiques with Nicaragua , Gambia , and Chad , and agreed to provide US$ 4.6 million worth of loans to the Dominican Republic to serve as a guarantee to help the latter secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund .\" We can not use pressure from Beijing as an excuse for We diplomatic setbacks , \" said Chen , who used concrete actions to demonstrate to the Dominican Republic \\'s allies that the Dominican Republic has no intention of pulling back from the Dominican Republic diplomatic partnerships ; on the contrary , the Dominican Republic the Dominican Republic will be working even harder than before .Chen President Chen Shui - bian left on August 13 for a 13 - day trip that included state visits to the Latin American nations of the Dominican Republic , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , as well as the west African nations of Gambia , Burkina Faso , and Chad .Before boarding the plane on the 13th , Chen Shui - bian delivered a short speech in which Chen Shui - bian stated , \" Taiwan must stand up and be counted . \"The purpose of this trip , said Chen Shui - bian , is to share Taiwan \\'s experiences with other countries , and Chen Shui - bian also indicated the hope that this trip would help to solidify Taiwan \\'s diplomatic relations .The entourage was the largest ever to accompany an the Dominican Republic president abroad , and included : Chuang Ming - yao -LRB- secretary - general , National Security Council -RRB- , Tien Hung - mao -LRB- minister of foreign affairs -RRB- , Lin Hsin - yi -LRB- minister of economic affairs -RRB- , Chen Po - chih -LRB- chairman , Council of Economic Planning and Development -RRB- , Chen Hsi - huang -LRB- chairman , Council of Agriculture -RRB- , Chung Chin -LRB- head of the Government Information Office -RRB- , Jeffrey Koo -LRB- chairman of the National Association of Industry and Commerce -RRB- , Wang Yu - tseng -LRB- chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of the Dominican Republic -RRB- , and Lin Kun - chung -LRB- chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries -RRB- .There were also many legislators in the delegation , including Hung Chi - chang , Helen Chu , Feng Ting - kuo , and Li Yin - yun .-LRB- Li is soon to assume a position as deputy director of the the Dominican Republic diplomatic post in Washington , DC . -RRB-The total size of the delegation came to nearly 200 people , including more than 50 journalists .The president kept to a very tight schedule during this trip .After a brief stopover in Los Angeles on the 13th , Chen Shui - bian continued on and reached the Dominican Republic on the 14th .He attended the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia there on the 16th , and was able to meet with the leaders and representatives of friendly nations from around the world .On the 17th Chen Shui - bian continued on to Nicaragua , where Chen Shui - bian met with President Arnoldo Aleman and delivered a speech to the Nicaraguan National Assembly .On the 18th , presidents Chen Shui - bian and President Arnoldo Aleman signed a joint communique before Chen Shui - bian departed for Costa Rica , where Chen Shui - bian received the Great Cross of Juan Mora Fernandez , a gold medal which is the nation \\'s highest award .On the 20th Chen Shui - bian flew across the Atlantic Ocean to Gambia to meet with Gambian President Yahya Jameh before heading on to Burkina Faso and a dinner with President Blaise Compaore .On the 23rd Chen Shui - bian delivered a speech to the Gambian parliament .The next stop on the itinerary was Chad , where Chen Shui - bian dined with Chad \\'s President Idris Debi .On the 25th Chen Shui - bian and Debi signed a joint communique and held a press conference before heading back to Taiwan slightly ahead of schedule to oversee efforts to deal with the powerful Typhoon Bilis .Chen \\'s stopover in Los Angeles was a sensitive subject , for Chen Shui - bian had originally planned an informal meeting with several members of the US Congress .After furious protests from Beijing and discouragement from the US State Department , however , Chen Shui - bian canceled the plan just the day before arriving in Los Angeles .A crowd of 500 to 600 Taiwanese living in the United States showed up to greet President Arnoldo Aleman at President Arnoldo Aleman hotel and protest against the US government \\'s \" caving in to Beijing at the expense of Taiwan . \"When Chen Shui - bian arrived on the 14th in the Dominican Republic , Chen Shui - bian was greeted at the airport by over 100 representatives of the Taiwanese business community there , and more than 700 Taiwanese residents threw a party for President Arnoldo Aleman that night at his hotel .The next day , Chen Shui - bian took advantage of the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia to meet with leaders from a number of countries with which the Dominican Republic the Dominican Republic has diplomatic relations , including the vice-president of El Salvador and the second vice president of Panama .On the 23rd Chen attended the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia President Hipolito Mejia .The the Dominican Republic contingent was larger than any other at the ceremony .The the Dominican Republic currently has diplomatic relations with 29 countries , half of which are located in Latin America and the Caribbean .In recent years , however , the Dominican Republic has continually upgraded the Dominican Republic trade links with the Dominican Republic the Dominican Republic \\'s diplomatic partners .The allegiance of a number of these countries may be put to the test in the coming years by various political and economic considerations .In the case of the Dominican Republic , for example , supporters of President Hipolito Mejia announced to the media on the eve of Chen Shui - bian \\'s arrival that the Dominican Republic was planning to build a large thermal power plant in supporters of President Mejia country .In addition , the Dominican Republic is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council in 2002 , and will certainly be lobbying for Beijing \\'s support .This situation could affect relations with Taiwan .On the bright side , Taiwan has scored a few points of Taiwan own in this diplomatic tug of war .When Chen Shui - bian arrived in Costa Rica on the 18th , Chen Shui - bian hosts departed from the pattern of the past few years by promising to support the Dominican Republic the Dominican Republic bid for membership in the United Nations .Costa Rica \\'s President Miguel Rodriguez also accompanied Chen Shui - bian on a tour of a Taiwanese export processing zone , an orchid farm run by Taiwan Sugar Corporation , and a vocational training school .President Chen Shui - bian departed on the 20th for Africa , where the Dominican Republic the Dominican Republic has eight diplomatic partners .Chen President Chen Shui - bian is the first the Dominican Republic president ever to travel to western Africa .There is little two - way trade between Taiwan and any of the three countries on Chen Shui - bian \\'s African itinerary .Instead , agricultural and economic assistance constitute the mainstays of Taiwan diplomatic ties with these countries .Taiwanese agricultural specialists stationed in Burkina Faso have converted 1,000 hectares of desert to arable land , while Taiwanese specialists sent to Gambia have successfully transplanted tomatoes , green beans , okra , and various leafy vegetables from Taiwan and raised successfully transplanted tomatoes , green beans , okra , and various leafy vegetables from Taiwan on Gambian soil .In addition to this type of technical assistance , Taiwan has also assisted with various infrastructure projects .Taiwan \\'s most notable contribution to Gambia \\'s infrastructure is the main terminal at the airport .Gambian Gambian President Yahya Jameh declared Gambian President Yahya Jameh support for admission of the Dominican Republic to the United Nations , and as a gesture of goodwill declared that all holders of the Dominican Republic passports would henceforth automatically be granted 90 - day landing visas upon arrival in Gambia .President Chen Shui - bian \\'s trip yielded many positive results and generated a lot of very favorable media coverage , but Chen \\'s trip was not problem - free .First , as President Arnoldo Aleman was preparing to depart Taiwan , the Nicaraguan foreign minister publicly called upon the Dominican Republic the Dominican Republic to make good on the previous administration \\'s promise of US$ 100 million in assistance .This remark sparked controversy in Taiwan , where some accused the new government of pursuing the same \" checkbook diplomacy \" practiced by its predecessor .Chen President Chen Shui - bian responded that while the new administration has not made plans for any new promises of foreign aid , neither will the new administration fail to honor the promises made by the new administration predecessor .Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao stated that the purpose of Chen \\'s trip was to consolidate Taiwan \\'s diplomatic ties , and to strengthen friendships by building upon the existing foundation .Tien stressed that President Arnoldo Aleman would not sign any new foreign aid agreements .President Chen Shui - bian received a very warm welcome in Nicaragua , but the local press still mentioned \" checkbook diplomacy \" in reporting on the visit .The the Dominican Republic \\'s ambassador to Nicaragua , Antonio Tsai , bluntly argued in a briefing with Chen Shui - bian that Taiwan \\'s foreign assistance to Nicaragua was being misused .According to Antonio Tsai , Taiwan \\'s foreign assistance to Nicaragua has been used to build a presidential palace and a new headquarters for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .Opposition politicians charge that the aid has done nothing for everyday people , and Western nations have also been critical .A second problem connected with this trip was the question of who would act in President Arnoldo Aleman \\'s stead while Chen Shui - bian was out of Nicaragua .Concern over this issue prompted Chen Shui - bian to state before Chen Shui - bian departure that Chen Shui - bian would remain commander - in - chief of the military forces , and that Chen Shui - bian would maintain hot lines to every cabinet - level agency .The president said that there was no need for an acting president because Chen Shui - bian had taken painstaking precautions to ensure domestic political stability during Chen Shui - bian absence .So is Taiwan \\'s diplomacy a way of giving back to the international community ?Or is it checkbook diplomacy ?Ambassador - without - portfolio Lu Yi - cheng wrote an article in which Ambassador - without - portfolio Lu Yi - cheng argued that foreign aid has always been universally recognized as a regular tool of diplomacy as well as a humanitarian necessity , and there is no reason why Taiwan should have to steer clear of Taiwan .He pointed out that the United Nations spend an average of 0.24 % of GNP on foreign aid , as opposed to 0.17 % in Taiwan \\'s case .In view of Taiwan \\'s economic strength , argued Ambassador - without - portfolio Lu Yi - cheng , our foreign aid expenditures need not be reduced ; in fact , our foreign aid expenditures should even be raised somewhat .The the Dominican Republic has been criticized a lot in recent years for pursuing checkbook diplomacy , so there was no surprise when this issue cropped up in connection with Chen \\'s trip .The question of an acting president , however , has never before been a matter of concern .This situation is to some degree a reflection of the fact that the public still has doubts about the new administration \\'s ability to govern .This is an important point that is worth keeping in mind .Paralympics Offer Stage for Taiwan PerformersClosing ceremonies for the 2000 Sydney Paralympics were held on October 29 .Nearly 4000 athletes from more than one hundred and twenty countries participated .This event , a manifestation of the ideal that \" the flame burns in the body , mind , and spirit of every individual , \" broke down international barriers and was an admirable example of the global village in operation .The the Dominican Republic team took one gold , two silvers , and four bronzes , marking the first time any Taiwan athlete has returned from an Olympic games with a gold .Also , as part of the events , Taiwan \\'s Crescent Moon Dance Troupe , made up of handicapped persons , was the only foreign troupe invited by the Australian government to participate in the Paralympic Arts Festival .But even more important than these honors was the spirit of overcoming all obstacles and facing life with courage that shone through during the Paralympics .The just - completed Paralympics were enriched by ethnic flavorings .The opening ceremony on October 18 was in the form of a welcoming for aboriginal elders .Amidst a festive atmosphere , the athletes entered the stadium by categories - one group in wheelchairs , another on crutches , another led by guide dogs .The events at the 12 - day Paralympics were packed with spectators .The 1.1 million tickets sold show the extent to which everyone took the games seriously .The the Australian government even set up a huge TV screen in Darwin , which is the port of entry for the most visitors to Australia , to broadcast the games live .The games were also a platform for the idea of the welfare state caring for disadvantaged groups , and for emphasizing how handicapped persons can break through barriers and limitations .On October 14 , Taiwan \\'s Crescent Moon Dance Company created a sensation with Taiwan \\'s Crescent Moon Dance Company performance \" Standing on the Highest Peak , \" performed in traditional vests and short skirts as worn by indigenous people in Taiwan .After the 10 - minute performance ended , the hall was rocked by thunderous applause .The standing ovation lasted three minutes , and some people were even moved to tears .The Crescent Moon Dance Company has only been in operation for four years .Organized by a group of amputee women on a nonprofessional basis , it is the world \\'s first dance troupe of it kind .As it manifesto reads : \" One with no voice may nonetheless sing .One with no wings may nonetheless soar .One with no limbs may nonetheless dance .The crescent moon and the full moon are the moon just the same , and equally beautiful . \"the world \\'s first dance troupe of its kind also delighted Sydney citizens with a performance at the Sydney City Hall on October 19 .In the competition , host country Australia took the most medals , including 64 golds.Among the Dominican Republic \\'s medals , the gold - the first ever for Taiwan - was won by Chiang Chih - chung .With a throw of 57.28 meters , Chiang shattered the world record for the javelin in the F12 visually - impaired class .Chiang , a member of the Bunun indigenous people , received a traditional hero \\'s welcome home from the Bunun of Sanmin Rural Township in Kaohsiung County .During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised Chiang for Chiang glorious deeds .Meanwhile , the the Dominican Republic table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time .In the wheelchair men \\'s doubles class 5 event , Chou Chang - sheng and Lin Yen - hung took the silver , while Chou Chang - sheng won another silver in the men \\'s singles .The men \\'s class 9 team for persons with non-leg - related disabilities and the women \\'s wheelchair team of combined classes 4 and 5 took bronzes in team events , while Li Ching - chung -LRB- men \\'s judo class 1 -RRB- and Lu Li - hua -LRB- women \\'s powerlifting class 1 -RRB- garnered individual bronzes .Among Asian countries , South Korea turned in the best performance , taking five gold medals .This was due in part to the fact that South Korea has provided special coaching in wheelchair table tennis to soldiers injured in service .Indeed , many handicapped competitors from other nations besides the ROK were retired veterans .Their pensions allow pensions free time to train , and through athletics pensions bring meaning to pensions lives and glory to pensions countries .Taiwan team members , on the other hand , come from a variety of backgrounds , and train out of personal interest .They must give up working if pensions wish to train full - time .The South Korean team of veterans , by overcoming pensions injuries to give a display of athleticism at the international level , have emerged from the shadow of war and transformed pensions handicaps into glorious results .This example should provide food for thought to the disabled and sports communities in the future .Pali : Storied Past , Uncertain Future-LRB- Lin I - hsien / photos by Diago Chiu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-I wonder if Pali is jealous of Tanshui .I ask because fate has treated these two towns , separated only by the mouth of the Tanshui River , very differently .Tanshui is celebrated in poems , songs , paintings , and lovers \\' memories of its scenic views .Pali has donuts , mussels , a garbage landfill , and troubles which have yet to be revealed to the outside world .Have you heard this legend ?Liao Tianding , Taiwan \\'s Robin Hood , fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in Pali , where he fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age 27 , was murdered in the Monkey Cave at Laochienkeng -LRB- in Pali Rural Township -RRB- by one of he best friends .Countless legends grew up around Liao after Liao death , and the people of Pali began to worship Liao spirit .In 1958 , Liao small burial plot was converted into a huge temple .He has followers scattered far and wide , and every year on the special day appointed for making offerings at a huge temple -LRB- the 26th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar -RRB- , the grounds are packed with cars and visitors .The Liao brothers , now in Ko brothers 60s , recall Ko brothers impressions of a visit to the Liao Tianding gravesite : \" It must have been 30 years ago , we used to go there just for the fun of It .The road in front of a huge temple was n\\'t so wide then , and what a crowd !People were so jammed in you could n\\'t move . \"People also recall that the Pali of those days was a place in which most people lived by fishing , farming , or petty trading .The Liao gives a thumbs - up and declares : \" That \\'s why I always say that a can - do guy like Liao Tianding must be looking after we , so that we have developed and can even earn money from the tourists . \"Yet , a can - do guy like Liao Tianding may not know about Pali \\'s real heyday , long in the past .The days of the sailing shipsPali was originally called Palifen , a transliteration of the place name used by the Ketagalan indigenous people .Located on the northwest corner of Taiwan , Pali faces the Taiwan Strait to northwest , rests against Mt. Kuanyin to the southeast , and looks across the river toward Tanshui to the northeast .Though it does n\\'t have much of a hinterland , it geographic location has proved historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the Ta - pen - keng and Shih - san - hang archeological sites .Later , when Han Chinese began trickling across to Taiwan , Han Chinese mainly settled along rivers .Because Pali is relatively close to the mainland and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that it does not have a natural harbor , in 1757 the Qing court designated it to be one of Taiwan \\'s small number of official ports for maritime transport with the mainland .Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of Pali .However , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in 1796 , Pali began to give way in importance to Tanshui , located just across the river .Once mainly dependent on fishing , Pali increasingly came to rely on farming .But the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .While the hardy people of Pali barely kept the hardy people of Pali stomachs filled , the hardy people of Pali children and grandchildren left in search of a better life .Neither the Japanese occupation -LRB- which began in 1895 -RRB- nor the return to Chinese rule -LRB- in 1945 -RRB- brought much joy or change to this rural area .But in the 1970s , urban planning came to Pali .It proved to be the prelude to a symphony -LRB- or perhaps cacophony -RRB- of transformation .Changing the rhythm of Pali lifeDuring the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in Taipei , builders put up self - described \" villas \" and \" mansions \" -LRB- apartment blocks , in fact -RRB- one after another in Pali .Also , to try to reduce the outflow of population from Pali and to get the stagnant local economy moving , South Korea decided to link this formerly isolated village to the outside world .What had been Chungshan Road was turned into Provincial Highway #15 , and the opening of the Kuantu Bridge to traffic linked Pali directly to the busy Taipei districts of Shilin and Peitou .Gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , Pali began to dream of a tourism boom .But fortune had other things in store .In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of Pali , the plan to develop tourism in Pali was scrapped overnight .The government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility .Then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western Taiwan for construction purposes , and a harbor was built on the Pali coast for the convenience of gravel transporters .In accordance with the urban plan , new streets were cut this way and that through Pali \\'s land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways .The sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .In 1997 , the Hsiachuotzu garbage landfill formally opened , and the Hsiachuotzu garbage landfill became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of Pali .This rural township , which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in Taipei County , seemed resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered by many outlying areas -RRB- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others .It is only recently that the residents of Hsiachuotsu , unable to stand the smell , have begun to protest .Lin Yi - hung , born and raised in Pali , stands on the roof of his house and looks across to the beach where his used to run and play as a child .He can not help but sigh , as a child his looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that have come to this area : \" These construction projects have destroyed the relationship we people of Pali used to have with the sea . \"It \\'s certainly true that a lot of people here thought a lot of people here would get rich from the rezoning .But just because land increases in value does n\\'t mean someone will buy land increases in value , and just because apartment complexes are built does n\\'t mean there are people who want to live there .Worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned in the struggle over divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money is involved .Lin concludes : \" I am not by any means opposed to development .But development is not necessarily the same as progress .Can the people of Pali really survive change of this magnitude ? \"All part of the urban plan ?One after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of Pali residents .But so far the only things Pali folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an \" otherworldly \" kind .The new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious to escape from Taipei City and return to nature .But at the same time , verdant Mt. Kuanyin - named for its uncanny resemblance to the deity Kuanyin - is covered with columbariums and cemeteries .Even Kuanyin , worshipped for Kuanyin limitless compassion and mercy , must be creasing Kuanyin brow at this rampant overuse of the mountain .Chen Chien - kuo , a secretary in the Pali Rural Township government , says facetiously : \" What can the Pali Rural Township government do ? the Pali Rural Township government have the mountains behind the Pali Rural Township government and the sea in front .People say the fengshui is good here , so us and come . \"Chien - kuo , a secretary in the Pali Rural Township government adds , in a far less amused tone , that South Korea has been talking about making Mt. Kuanyin a national park for a long time , and has banned construction or use of the mountain .But after 30 years , the plan to develop tourism in Pali is still a non-starter , and meanwhile many cemeteries and colum - bariums have \" snuck in . \"\" Nobody seems to care about Pali Pali , and our are very remote , so people just dump what people do n\\'t want out here .We say that this is why our not only have a water pollution treatment plant and a garbage landfill , but also five nursing homes and hospices for the terminally ill . \"Take the Taipei Happy Mountain Colony for example .This venerable institution was first used to house leprosy victims , who met only fear and loathing elsewhere .In 1932 , a British missionary founded this home - over the strong opposition of the local gentry - to offer leprosy victims a place to live in dignity and find warmth away from the cold outside world .Today , the mountain is a home for physically and mentally challenged young people , and the simple old structure , surrounded by greenery , rings with the laughter of children .Li Li - chuan , who works at the mountain , was born and raised right here in Pali .Her family home is not far from the chil - dren \\'s home .\" When I was small I used to come here to play .All the adults called the kids \\' empty - headed . \\'I was small , and did n\\'t know any better , so I just called the adults that too . \"Stroking the head of a sleeping child with hydrocephalus , hydrocephalus says : \" He is so cute when He smiles ! \"Located on the margins of the island of Taiwan , the people of Pali take it in stride that the people of Pali must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast off by society - waste water , trash , the deceased , and victims of diseases that society would prefer not to see at all .And there is no sign this situation will end : Reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved to Linkou for a land reclamation project there will be trucked along Provincial Highway #15 - right through the heart of Pali .Serving Greater Taipei\" I believe , \" says Lin Yi - hung , \" that the people of Pali understand that this is just the way society works -the interests of the few are sacrificed so that the majority can be better off . \"Thus , in urban plans Pali is always assigned the role of serving Taipei .\" But South Korea should think carefully about whether South Korea are using the right methods or not .There are no real comprehensive policies , just short - term trade - offs of interests .There are a lot of great - sounding plans , but what do the people of Pali get out of the people of Pali ?It \\'s like the port the people of Pali built for transporting gravel .There are a lot of bright promises for the future , raising people \\'s hopes , but who knows what the final result will really be ? \"Chang Tsu - chou , now in Chang Tsu - chou 70s , has been a secretary in South Korea for more than 30 years , and loves Pali more than words can say .\" I was first sent here to work in the Kuomintang Public Service Department .When I came here , they were only selling about 30 newspapers in all of Pali .But I went all out to promote newspaper sales , and by the time I left the Kuomintang Public Service Department , they were selling more than 1000 ! \"He has great confidence in Pali \\'s future , and believes a harbor will bring prosperity .\" South Korea says that the first phase is for transporting gravel , but when the first phase is completed a lot of goods will be shipped in and out of here .At that time , Pali should really be hopping ! \"Pali , known as \" the home of green bamboo shoots \" for its famous local vegetable , is - like many remote areas all over Taiwan - accepting the pain and enjoying the pleasures of life in the space between hopeful expectations and disappointing letdowns .And , being marginal , its also must live with burdens that the citizens themselves do not want .Uncertain whether to makes fists or open the citizens themselves arms , the people of Pali watch , perplexed , as the great wheel of our times leaves the great wheel of our times tracks through the citizens themselves rural township .Yet these are hardy people , who will always bounce back with a smile to face the unknown future , be it filled with troubles or glory .Pali Facts and FiguresPali Rural Township -LRB- also spelled Bali -RRB- is located at the northwestern edge of the Taipei Basin , on the western bank of the mouth of the Tanshui River .It has an area of 39.5 square kilometers and a population of just over 28,000 .It is one of the 29 townships under the jurisdiction of Taipei County .Pali produces wax apples , green bamboo shoots , and wendan pomelo which are famous far and wide for their delicate texture and sweetness .In addition , Chinese raspberries and strawberry pears are now being cultivated , with promising results so far .The main attractions include the so - called \" eight views of Pali , \" the ferry boat scenic tour , hiking on Mt.

            "In the summer of 2005 , a picture that {people} [1] have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major {Hong Kong} [2] media .With {their} [1] unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused {Hong Kong} [2] to be a focus of worldwide attention .The world 's fifth {Disney} [3] park will soon open to the public here .The most important thing about {Disney} [3] is that {it} [3] is a global brand .Well , for several years , although {it} [3] was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed {Hong Kong} [2] with new respect .Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of {Hong Kong Disneyland} [4] .The construction of {Hong Kong Disneyland} [4] began two years ago , in 2003 .In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of {Lantau Island} [5] that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .One .Since then , {this area} [6] has become a prohibited zone in {Hong Kong} [2] .As {its} [6] neighbor on {Lantau Island} [5] , {Hong Kong International Airport} [7] had to change {its} [7] flight routes to make {this area} [6] a no - fly zone .Mickey Mouse 's new home , settling on Chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .There 's only one month left before the opening of {Hong Kong Disneyland} [4] on September 12 {.The subway to Disney} [8]{Disney} [9] has already been constructed .At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for {Disney} [9] on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy {the park} [10] when {it} [8] first opens .Meanwhile , the {Disney} [9] subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as {the park} [10] .For two years , {Disney} [9] has constantly maintained {its} [9] mystery .No media have been allowed to enter for photos .We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward {Disney} [9] , trying to experience {this mysterious park} [10] from close by .However , before any of the {Disney} [9] symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by {a security guard} [11] at the intersection of the road towards {Disney} [9] .On {our} [12] way back , the taxi driver gave {us} [12] an explanation after understanding {our} [12] intentions .Er , according to what {the security guard} [11] said , for the time before everything is officially , opened , , {no cars} [13] can enter unless {they} [13] have special permission .No one can enter otherwise .Video recording is especially forbidden .Ah , everything is top secret .If pictures are taken without permission , {%pw} [14] that is to say , {it} [14] will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .Although Disney Corporation chose {Hong Kong} [15] as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between {Hong Kong} [15] and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit {Hong Kong} [15] .From the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists , have come to {Hong Kong} [15] .Well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .At this point , it has been about two years .Also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .Hong {Kong} [15] was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today 's international metropolis .Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .When in {Hong Kong} [15] , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in Mong Kok .You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay , where all deities gather .You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in {Hong Kong} [15] .You can ascend Victoria Peak to get a panoramic view of {Victoria Harbor} [16] 's beautiful scenery .Or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .After dark , cruise {Victoria Harbor} [16] at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .Every corner of {Hong Kong} [15] is filled with fun .Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the {Hong Kong} [15] tourism industry bring us ?Over the past 28 years , {the Ocean Park} [17] has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to {Hong Kong} [15] .Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of {Hong Kong Island} [18] and the South China Sea .These items , which were the pride of {the Ocean Park} [17] , have made {this place} [19] the most popular tourist attraction in {Hong Kong} [15] for some time .However , since {Disney} [20] entered {Hong Kong} [15] , {the Ocean Park} [17] , sharing the same city as {Disney} [20] , has felt the pressure of competition .To improve {the park} [17] 's brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .That is , {the entire park} [17] will be divided into seven sections for renovation .Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .It seems that {those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center} [21] will also be renovated after several years .Are {they} [21] going to be different from what {they} [21] are now ?{They} [21] will be , in ten years .Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .It looks like {we} [22] will also bring in whales .Er , {we} [22] will implement {this plan} [23] as soon as {it} [23] is approved by the government .Groundbreaking is expected to start next year .Yes .The area of {Hong Kong} [15] is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .The population is dense .Natural resources are relatively scarce .However , {the clever Hong Kong people} [24]{Hong Kong} [15] people will utilize all resources {they} [24] have created for developing the {Hong Kong} [15] tourism industry .Among these is {the Avenue of Stars} [25] .Entering {Hollywood} [26]{Hollywood of the East} [27]{the East} [28] ,here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .He is my .She is my Goddess , ah .Please stay with {us} [22] on New World Travel .Hong {Kong} [15] has always worn the crown of {Hollywood} [26]{Hollywood of the East} [27]{the East} [28] .Over the past 100 years of film history , {Hong Kong} [15] cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .They have shortened the distance between {Hong Kong} [15] and {the world} [29] .Hong Kong movies have even become a window for {the world} [29] to see {Hong Kong} [15] , which have made the image of metropolitan {Hong Kong} [15] more prominent internationally .For this reason , in 2004 , on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor , the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed {the Avenue of Stars} [25] , memorializing {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong 's} [15] 100 - year film history .Here , {tourists} [30] can learn about {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong 's} [15] film history , and can come up close with the stars in {their} [30] mind .Hong {Kong} [15] is a busy metropolis .Even at dusk , {the city} [15] 's pulse never stops beating .Across from {the Avenue of Stars} [25] , a special performance is staged every weekend .%pw As {our} [31] {Victoria Harbor} [32] is %pw very famous , and , er , {our} [31]{our nightscape} [33] is already very beautiful , by what means could {we} [31] enhance the dynamic beauty of {our} [31]{our nightscape} [33] ?So , one idea was to transform {Victoria Harbor} [32] into a performance stage .Er , each key building is like a performer .It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza , Bank of {China} [34] Tower , at 8:00 every Saturday night , HSBC Main Building .Their performances will be on schedule .Center of {the East Central .Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island} [35] reveal {themselves} [35] one by one , participating in {the show in full splendor} [36] , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to {the light show} [36] .Some , er , cities have consulted with us .Uh-huh .Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .Yes .The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of {Hong Kong} [37] hopes to be involved , so that {the Hong Kong tourism industry} [38]{Hong Kong} [37] tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .Hong Kong Wetland Park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of {the Hong Kong SAR government} [39] for advancing {the Hong Kong tourism industry} [38]{Hong Kong} [37] tourism industry .This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by {the Hong Kong government} [39] for {its} [39] people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .Hong {Kong Wetland Park} [40] covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor 's center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .In the indoor exhibition hall , {tourists} [41] can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of {the world} [42] , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .Outdoors , {they} [41] can also personally experience wetland ecology ., er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,but behind me is {our Wetland Park} [40]{our} [43] {Wetland Park} [40] .Ha , entirely different .Quite primitive ,er , a fresh water swamp ,er , the Wetland Park Exploration Center .Lastly , farthest away you can see Putian of {Shenzhen} [44] .Then , , on {the bridge} [45] is {Hong Kong} [15] and outside is {Shenzhen} [44] .You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in {our} [43] daily life .Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .Ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many {Hong Kong} [15] children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .Look over there .They are going to be ripe soon .The long one over there .Oh .Yes ., with ears , ah .Where ?Ah , here .Perhaps there will be an introduction so that {children} [46] will know the names of the crops when {they} [46] see {them} [46] ., let {them} [46] get some understanding .Mai Po Marshes adjacent to {Wetland Park} [40] is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong 's} [15] skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in {Hong Kong} [15] {Wetland Park} [40] .These have become the best spots to observe birds .Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .It is an endangered bird species throughout {the world} [42] .Uh-huh .Ah , there are only about 1,500 in {the world} [42] .Wow .Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of {them} [47] come to {Hong Kong} [15] to spend the winter .Some of {them} [47] , er , have stayed in {Hong Kong} [15] {Wetland Park} [40]{Wetland Park .Uh} [40]-huh .So , {our} [48] park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .Uh-huh .Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .They will complete {the park} [40] 's entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign .Ah , {we} [48] have established the year 2006 as {Discover Hong Kong} [15]{Discover Hong Kong Year} [49] .Why is that ?Because , as everyone knows , {our} [48] Disneyland will open in September of this year .In addition , {we} [48] will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to {the Giant Buddha} [50] .They add to what {we} [48] already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .Moreover , er , {we} [48] are including {our} [48] software .Hong {Kong} [15] 's software is very well known .Like what 's used in {our} [48] Symphony of Lights .We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 {Discover Hong Kong Year} [49] .Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .Because your line connects us with two --In recent years , {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong 's} [15] tourist attractions have gradually moved from {Hong Kong Island} [18] to Kowloon and {the New Territory} [51] .Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on {Lantau Island} [18] of {the New Territory} [51] .For this reason , {Lantau Island} [18] has become a new {Hong Kong} [15] tourism popular spot .The earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .Therefore , {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong 's} [15] Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of {China} [34] , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in {the east} [28] , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of {China} [34] .As a result , {this place} [19] has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .However , to {common tourists} [52] , more of what {this place} [19] brings {them} [52] is wonder and awe .Since {this giant bronze Buddha} [50] settled on {Lantau Island} [18] , {the world} [29] renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and {Disneyland} [53] have also been constructed here in succession .The {important status of Lantau Island} [54]{Lantau Island} [18] is increasingly apparent .No , {it} [54] was totally inaccessible in the past .In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting {Hong Kong} [15] , {Zhuhai} [55] , and {Macao} [56] .In 1992 --Could n't go in summer --So , after their return , {Macao} [56] , and {Hong Kong} [15] , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .It 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .One has to go up to {Shenzhen} [44] , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to {Zhuhai} [55] , then pass through {Zhuhai} [55] to get to {Macao} [56] .For a {Hong Kong} [15] person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .With {this bridge} [57] , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .This is what we have seen since 1999 .Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .Well , originally the construction of the new --With this new {Hong Kong} [15] - {Zhuhai} [55] - {Macao} [56] bridge that basically leads to all three places , {Hong Kong} [15] , {Macao} [56] , and {Zhuhai} [55] , basically , at the start of {the bridge} [45] , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .Macao is {this way} [58] , and {Zhuhai} [55] is {this way} [58] .From the perspective of either {Hong Kong} [15] , {Macao} [56] , or {Zhuhai} [55] , our concept is a tourism zone .Er , %pw {Zhuhai} [55] for sightseeing tours , {Macao} [56] for entertainment , and we have {Disneyland} [53] and , other attractions in {Hong Kong} [15] .Each {place} [59] has different attractions of {its} [59] own .So , with {this bridge} [57] , when {some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries} [60]{mainland China} [61] or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems {they} [60] can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .Once {the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge} [62]{Macao} [56] bridge is built , {it} [62] will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in {Macao} [56] before having fun at {Disneyland} [53] just an hour later .Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .However , even though {it} [62] has entered the last countdown period before {its} [62] final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off {its} [62] mysterious veil .Ah , currently {it} [62] has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 .There 's also what we call soft opening {.Ah} [63] , {they} [64] are now rehearsing {.Ah} [63] , , ah , {some groups} [65] , {they} [64] are rehearsing {their} [65]{their service} [66] , well , hoping that {they} [64] will become used to {the service} [66] , be familiar with {it} [66] , when {our} [67]{our tourists} [68] come in September .Well , I am very confident , that when {our} [67]{our tourists} [68] come to {Disneyland} [53] , {they} [68] will certainly return home very satisfied .The Wonder Tour will start from {Hong Kong} [15] .This {dynamic metropolis} [69] never ceases {its} [69] movement .It continues to explore ; {it} [69] continues to open new worlds .Each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .Hong {Kong} [15] is a world famous shopping paradise .What determined the position of {Hong Kong} [15] as a shopping paradise ?Is it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low prices ?Is it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?After all , what are the joyful memories from inside paradise ?We respectfully invite you to watch {Hong Kong} [15] : a Shopping Paradise in this edition of Across China .Hello ,

[112] left your laboratories you 've now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.is that true /?Well hi {Paula} [113] /.yes {we} [114] have /.Uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago {our} [114]{our analysts and historians} [115] got to work on {that /.and} [116] {they} [115] were able to wittle {it} [116] down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.and at this point {they} [115] 've wittled {it} [116] down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.So we 've gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.So how much easier will that make it for you to unlock {this case} [111] , do you think /?Well I think {it} [111] 'll help quite a bit /.Um any time {you 've} [117] got a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they 're in pretty good condition such as this one is , it 's mummified remains /.We have some soft tissue we can deal with /.so we can look at the color of the hair /.we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.and that 's where we 're going to now /.So in the interest of full disclosure what I know about forensics is basically what I 've learned on CSI /.and one would think that because you 've got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential DNA match with what {you 've} [117] found in the ice /.Is it not that simple /?Well no no it 's not that simple /.Um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what {we} [118] 're looking at /.And what {we} [118] want to do is {we} [118] do n't want to just look at the material evidence that {we} [118] have and immediately um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.What {we} [118] want to do is have {the evidence} [119] speak for {itself} [119] /.and when we look at {this individual} [120] as we 've done the biological profile looking at {his} [121] remains {his} [121] bones {his} [121] teeth and the material evidence /.and what we 're able to tell from {this individual} [120] is that {he} [121] died in {his} [121] twenties {he} [121] stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um {he} [121] sustained massive trauma to {his} [121] body on impact /.And {he} [121] 's Caucasoid male /.and so {we} [122] know much more now just one week later than what {we} [122] did when {he} [121] came in about eight days ago /.So the most important question is when do you think you 're going to know exactly who {he} [121] is /?Well that 's the most commonly asked question that we have /.and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.Nobody knows for sure exactly when {we} [122] 'll identify {him} [121] /.What it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for

to study the plan {the president} [176] put forth today /.Does it go far enough in your estimation /?You know what 's sort of interesting {Paula} [185] /.on one hand it is remarkable that {the

[186] /.and I think that 's remarkable to a lot of people eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of {bird flu} [182] happens that takes probably a lot more money and really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.The other thing {Paula} [185] really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that {we} [187] 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than {we} [187] were in nineteen eighteen , {we} [187] have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in {the hospital behind me} [184] that can take care of critically ill patients /.The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so {we} [187] just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic {Paula} [185] /.Uh let 's talk about the other problem of the plan where {the president} [176] wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like {Tamaflu and Rolenza} [188] /.Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself /?here 's the important thing about that /.We do n't know for sure /.A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on {Tamaflu and Rolenza} [188] /.These are antiviral drugs /.they are not vaccines /.They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad {the flu} [189] might effect you uh try to lessen {its} [189] impact /.But we only know that {it} [189] might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose

/.And on top of that now there 's a statement that 's come up from Joran Van Der Sloot that {he} [308] 's given to {the police} [309] uh one of twenty - two statements {he} [308] 's given by the way that um {Deepak} [295] had uh raped {her} [295] and killed {her} [295] on the beach /.So at this point what {the police} [309] have you know again {we} [310] 're unaware because {we} [310] 're not getting any information from law enforcement /.so {we} [310] have to go on the course of information that {we} [310] 're gathering on behalf of the family /.Well let me ask Harold how do you all know that /?I mean that information for example about that particular statement that TJ was just mentioning /.How do {we} [310] know that /?Yeah how do you know that {that statement} [311] was actually made by Joran Van Der Sloot /?Oh {we} [310] do n't /.This is the statements that were being attributed to {us} [310] on those /.Uh since {we} [310] have n't interviewed {Joran} [284] we do n't know exactly what {he} [284] has said /.but some of {that statement} [311] has been let out /.and uh through a chain of different individuals uh uh they have told {us} [310] uh what {the statement} [311] was /.TJ just so I 'm clear where are you getting that from that {that statement} [311] was made by {Joran} [284] about {Deepak} [295] /?I have seen a copy of {the statement} [311] from one of the local newspapers here um Diario /.Um {Jossy Mansur} [312] produced and showed me a copy of {that statement} [311] that uh Joran Van Der Sloot made um the last time that I was here in Aruba /.and uh {he} [312] conveyed it from Dutch into English and uh showed me {the statement} [311] /.Uh TJ are you in any trouble there /?I mean there 's been a lot of discussions about the authorities getting uh annoyed about you knocking on doors and things like that /.Well it 's not that /.Um there was some /.the Aruban authorities /-and we 've had conversations about this /.This is squared away /.It 's been straightened out /.Um there was uh some evidence that leaked out to the fact that had an arrest warrant for my arrest on Wednesday and that I was working without a work permit and I was going to be deported by {law enforcement} [313] and Wednesday night {the law enforcement} [313] was looking for me to arrest me /.Uh all that is untrue /.and I want to make that perfectly clear /.Uh this was brought up by another media station here on the island that uh made claim to that /.but I can to assure /.Alright {/.It} [314] 's not true /.We 'll move on /.Alright /.Yes /.Alright /.Um uh {Harold} [315] finally this landfill /.Uh are you hopeful uh that {EquuSearch} [279] is going to find something /?How credible do you think that {witness} [316] is who says that {he} [316] saw three men dumping what looked like a blonde body /?Well uh as a retired FBI agent I 'm always hopeful for an outcome /.Uh we interviewed the individual at length /.and having experienced hundreds if not thousands of interviews during my thirty - one years uh {this guy} [270] was very uh online /.He did n't go mm ah /.I mean {he} [270] was like telling a story /.and it did n't appear to me at all like {he} [270] was coached or practiced /.Mhm /.He just told a story uh from the beginning to the end /.and I believe {him} [270] /.I think there was something there /.if there is {the body} [317] , whether {it} [317] 's still there is another story /.Mhm {/.There} [318] has been uh a period of time since then /.and {it} [318] could have been removed again /.But uh {his} [270] story I think is credible /.We also had a /-TJ /.Sorry go ahead /.finish up {Harold} [315] /.No go ahead /.I was just going to a- /-I 'm out of time /.I was going to ask TJ bottom line do you think that you 're going to be able to crack the case in the next uh couple weeks /?Well it depends /.I believe that law enforcement uh since {the FBI} [266] 's been here has been working very credibly /.Mhm /.And uh I believe that they have something um that 's probably solid enough and hopeful uh come September fourth that Joran Van Sloot will stay where he 's positioned right now /.Mhm /.and that there 'll be additional arrests in this matter from uh parties and individuals that waited we already know that are possibly involved in this disappearance /.Alright /.TJ Ward and {Harold Phipps} [300] thanks a

{the medical book} [332] /.She did n't actually bring {it} [332] into the deliberation room {/.the} [335]{/.the jurors} [336] were meeting /.They rendezvoused at a juvenile hall in Santa Maria /.and

/.And this is number five /.Uh this is again {the Daily News} [334] /.That {Cook} [327] uh admits that {she} [327] frequently winked at {Jackson} [319] 's mother um Katherine in court and exchanged

executive producer Harvey Levin criminal defense attorney Daniel Horowitz /.Harv what do you make of /-Look you 've followed this close /.What do you make of all this /?Well I think {Eleanor Cook} [327] is a wacko {Dan} [354] /.and I think if any of {these allegations} [355] are true these jurors need to be prosecuted /.I mean this is jury tampering from within the jury if {these allegations} [355] are true /.And if there is ever to be a fair celebrity trial again especially in {California} [356] somebody needs to say look we are drawing the line /.You 're not going to get books at the end of the rainbow and do things inappropriate /.If {it} [357] pans out {it} [357] 's true I think Tom Sneddon himself should prosecute without respect to whether it would have been pro or anti {Michael Jackson} [319] /.So {Susan} [358] let 's assume for a minute it 's true /.Again you 're the prosecutor /.and you 're sitting there going are you kidding me /?There were two or three jurors who wanted to convict /.and {they} [359] caved because {they} [359] were pressured or whatever /.You ca n't do anything , can you /?Nothing /.eh game over /.You ca n't take an appeal from an aquittal /.The problem that I have with this is as members of the media we had an awfully difficult time with access to this trial /.If this is going to set a precedent to shut media out because these highly publicized celebrity trials yield these faulty verdicts {she} [360] 's doing far far more harm than {she} [360] could ever understand /.Yeah but let 's forget about the media stuff /.I mean the bottom line is {the prosecutors} [361] ca n't do anything about this , right /?I mean if {the jurors} [362] were tampering with evidence , if {they} [362] were playing with evidence et cetera back there {the prosecutors} [361] have to just suck {it} [363] up and be depressed /.There 's no remedy /.They have to eat {it} [363] /.It 's over /.Daniel I mean {Stacy} [353] does n't really believe {them} [362] /.but what do you think /?Well {Dan} [354] I believe {them} [362] /.You know {jurors} [364] are people /.We expect {them} [364] to be perfect little robots doing what the judge says /.and {they} [364] do n't /.They 're going to watch television /.I 'm sure {they all} [365] watch your show /.and {they} [365] watched {Susan} [358] try to convict {Michael Jackson} [319] /.but then I hope {they} [365] listened to me and to reason /.But the bottom line is {they} [365] reached a fair and just verdict /.You have to trust people and nail those attempts to control and hypercontrol this case /.Just backfired /.It made {the jurors} [362] feel isolated /.and now {they} [362] 're all quiet /.They wo n't talk to us about what really went on /.Okay here 's my problem /.It 's {this woman} [366] saying {she} [366] was forced and bullied right into reaching the verdict that {she} [366] did {/.and} [367] there {she} [366] is saying I did n't like the way that {this woman} [366] snapped at me talking about the accuser 's mother et cetera /. /.You know {Dan} [354] I do n't even talk to juries afterwards unless I win because you 're always going to hear things like that /.People in a jury room are in a bar room brawl /.It 's not supposed to be pretty /.and when it 's over there 's always second thoughts and regrets /.but {it} [368] 's the system /.and {it} [368] works /.Harvey you know what /.eh hey hey if I may say /-But {Dan} [354] your point is that /-You know a bar room brawl is one thing /.They were acting like outlaws if these allegations are true /.Right /.And you know I agree {Susan} [358] that {the prosecutors} [361] ca n't do anything to {Michael Jackson} [319] /.but {they} [361] certainly can do something to the jurors {/.and} [367] I think it is more important right now to say /-I 'm telling you {Dan} [354] you and I have covered a lot of trials in {this city /.and} [367] we 've seen a lot of weird things happen since OJ Simpson with books and everything else /.If jurors realize that there 's a back end if you will which is a Hollywood term to these trials and if {they} [369] get caught so what {they} [369] get caught but {they} [369] can still publish {a

n't {it} [371] /?No /.the real reason is {Dan} [354] believe {it} [371] or not I have a conscience /.I wrote Man Behind the Mask with {Bob Jones} [372] because I believed in {Bob Jones} [372]{Bob

Kobilinsky /.Alright so {Susan} [358] what do you know about the investigation /?Well {NBC news} [325] has learned from a law enforcement source that {the wife} [387] is not a suspect and that they are focusing in on these two Russian brothers as you said who live in {Brooklyn} [382] /.The {California} [356] teen is apparently the key to {the case} [388] at this point /.That 's law enforcement 's focus /.If this young man will talk this could break open what happened to George /.The key question is is this a tragic accident or is this foul play /?Right now law enforcement seems to think it 's foul play /.US attorney Kevin O'Connor said we have reason to believe there could have been foul play here /.Um alright uh Mister Zalisko do you know anything from your personal experience of having been on {the cruise} [390] as to what happened /?Uh good evening sir /.Uh first I 'd just like to clarify I 'm a police chief in Oak Hill Florida not {Orlando} [389] /.Uh now as far as {the cruise} [390] uh I was on {the cruise} [390] that uh uh day /.and the way I became aware of what occured was that uh the morning of the fifth {a relative of mine} [391] had mentioned that there was blood stain on the canopy beneath {her} [391] uh balcony /.at {that point} [392] {we} [393] kind of dismissed {it} [392] /.We did n't know what was uh going on /.Uh {we} [393] then went on {our} [393] daily excursion /.However later on into {the cruise} [390] that day uh {the ship} [381] 's captain went onto {the PA system} [394] and made an announcement that uh {authorities} [395] were on {the ship} [381] and {they} [395] were investigating the possibility that an individual had gone overboard during the night or early morning hours /.When I asked {my cousin} [396] {the uh size of the blood splatter} [397] {she} [396] had indicated {it} [397] was relatively the size of a small uh dog of a beagle type /.However viewing those photographs on TV that blood splatter is much larger than uh a small dog /.Mhm /.In fact it 's maybe three to four feet in length /.And then we 've been hearing many stories that uh there were a lot of people going into and out of the state rooms uh which would indicate that the crime scene was not properly secured in the early stages of the investigation /.Well /.Alright let me play this piece of sound from one of the passengers who was uh staying right nearby uh this particular uh room /.We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin /.Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing /.And {he} [398] says uh later um chief that {he} [398] heard a horrific thud /.Well yeah that would indicate that something did go on there /.and we know uh that {the three individuals} [399] were in a room uh with {Mister Smith} [380] /.And the question that has to be uh presented to everybody is why is it taking so long for authorities to interview the individual that was in a cabin next door /?Mhm /.Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after {the crime} [400] /.Yeah /.Yeah /.And you would not just interview that individual next door /.You would have to take a step to interview people above below and to both sides /.Susan what 's the answer to that /?But Dan /.there are jurisdictional problems here /.You know it 's not a clear cut case as to who gets to prosecute {this case} [401] /.Turkey ca n't do anything without a body /.United States can /.Fair play of the United States for stepping in /.fair play to law enforcement for getting involved /.Jurisdiction is n't clear /.but they 're working very hard to solve {the crime} [400] /.I do n't think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in {this case} [401] /.Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got {their} [402] investigators and {their} [402] lawyers in from what I understand right away to make this go away /.so I think {law enforcement} [403] was put in a bad position trying to play catchup {/.and} [373] I think {they} [403] 're doing +an amazing job /.Larry so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence /?Well it 's very difficult {Dan} [354] {/.Uh} [404] obviously as {we} [405] keep saying {we} [405] do not have a body /.therefore {we} [405] do not have a cause or a manner of the death /.But {we} [405] do have some physical evidence /.Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me it was not done the proper way /.It was n't a forensic photograph /.So I really do not know how large {the stain} [406] was in {its} [406] dimensions /.but it is pretty clear that there 's a lot of blood there great deal of blood /.It makes you think that something criminal occured /.But again getting back to how you solve the crime you got to go to the crime scene /.and I think there are multiple scenes here /.Every place there 's blood it 's a crime scene /.But the most important place is the cabin because that 's presumably where the injury took place /.Now there was some rumor about some arguments going casino the night before {/.Uh} [404] and it could very well be that {he} [404] was arguing with {these individuals} [399] /.so uh that could be the tie the connection /.and I think good policework would connect {the individuals} [399] in question with the casino with {Mister Smith /.and} [373]{Mister Smith} [380] /.and that might help {us} [407] understand what happened /.this is um a little bit more sound /.This is again from {Cletus Hyman} [408] uh who was literally um in a joining or nearby cabin um as to what {he} [409] heard around {he} [409] said four in the

very small percentage of those that are out there /.Statistically one in four girls and as many as one in six to ten boys are sexually assaulted before they are eighteen /.That 's nationwide /.This

{he} [467] said that Ye Ting should not be called Marshal Ye Ting but rather General Ye Ting .Right , right , right , General Ye Ting .Why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?Um , {he} [467] died in '46 .That marshal , afterward , after Liberation , um , it was conferred on {him} [467] , so only then --OK , {we} [477] 'll call {him} [467] General Ye Ting .Mm .Because ,Very naughty ?To what extent were you naughty then ?In fact I was a very well - behaved child .But I was , forced into {it} [478] , , if you were n't naughty there was no way to survive .What do you mean forced into {it} [478] ?During {the Cultural Revolution} [475] , , um , {my family} [468] was considered capitalist roaders .So {the kids} [479] then did n't want to play with you , or {they} [479] would tease you , {that sort of thing} [480] .Mm .So you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,Why was that ?Was it because people for example would say that {your father} [481] was such and such , or {your family} [468] was such and such .Right .So it was because of {that sort of thing} [480] ?Right , the majority of it was like that .Mm .Mm .Because you had to face them alone , OK , {a dozen people who wanted to fight you .You} [482] had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough .So {that} [483] was , the only way you could overcome {them} [482] and get the upper hand .Mm .Were you tough ?Mm .Very tough .Tough enough to --Because , there was no way , if you were n't tough that was it , , how could you manage .You were the son of capitalist roaders , , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it 's perfectly normal .Mm ., I remember one time , we were digging out {an air - raid shelter , that --Those , good kids} [484] , {they} [484] went there and threw stones .I did n't dare defend {myself} [483] , so I just had to endure it for quite a while .Mm .Finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on {the head} [485] , And I got angry , so angry that I rushed out with {a shovel} [486] and hit {them} [486] with {the shovel} [486] .Where did {the shovel} [486] come from ?From digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right .Mm .So you picked up {the shovel} [486] and rushed {them} [486] .Did you crack somebody 's head open ?Mm , anyhow , yes , I cracked {their head} [485]{their} [486] head open , it was very tragic .All of a sudden nobody was making a sound .Very --Once I fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me .How many of {them} [487] did you take out ?I hit one of {them} [487] and that was enough .Nopbody went to get {the schoolmaster or somebody 's father} [488] ?{They} [488] did , and there was a huge fuss .Mm .Because when I was little , having a big fight like that .Mm .Anyhow , more or less , , on average , every two years I changed school , and that 's how it had to be .Mm .I remember one time -- Mm , also , when I was in fifth or sixth grade , {someone} [489] yelled out , Down with {Ye Zhengming} [476] , {he} [489] was yelling at {me} [489] , and I had to fight them .Mm .After the fight I went home , and {my father} [481] was standing far away ., the factory , , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters Down with {Ye Zhengming} [476] , , the slogan .Mm .I got accustomed to {it} [490] while passing by at that time , and now when I think about {it} [490] , it seems very much like a stage play .Mm .Back then I felt , looking at {him} [481] standing so far away --I walked over to {him} [481] , and {he} [481] said , um , you really do n't understand anything .At the time I felt like I had a grievance .And I felt , I was fighting for you , {the people} [491] were cursing you , and I was fighting {them} [491] .In fact that 's the way kids think .Mm .You think , you bastard .What you say does n't count .you come after {me} [489] and I 'll take you down .You come down , and I 'll take you down .If you have balls , you come on down .Come on down .Come down .Come down , come on , fight , fight , fight .I say you take a whack .Whack .I 'm telling you , if you kill somebody you 'll pay with your life , do you understand ?, You 've already handed {him} [481] over .I sent someone .OK , OK , I sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at {me} [489] .Come on , take a whack at {me} [489] .Take a whack at {me} [489] .Your dad knows who broke the window .Take a whack .Take a whack .Take a whack .Are n't you willing to be friends with us ?Yes , I am {.He} [492] says {he} [492] 's willing .Did you hear ?{He} [492] says {he} [492] 's willing .Ok , that 's all right , let 's go play .This is a movie directed by Ye , called There 's a Place Called Wangjiazhan .Wangjiazhuang , right .This is obviously {him} [492] as a boy , uh , a memory of {his} [492] childhood life .Right .Right .Which {child} [493] is you .Is this child you , or is that child you ?Actually {we} [494] should be accurate ; {this child} [493] 's experiences ,So this child ,Um , right , right , right , because once , IMy father was denounced , and then the rebels took {us} [494] , took {that child} [493] to see .Mm .They denounced {my father} [481] , so I was very indignant ,{They} [495] let a lot of people expose my father ,Mm .Then the day after I took a kitchen knife and ran over to {their} [495] home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that I 'd hack the guy up .A kitchen knife ; a knife from your kitchen at home .Oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .Then I was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n't just hack people up .But I had already said it .What did you say ?said I have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like {this child} [493] .But , {those adults standing around} [496] reasoned with {me} [497] , said look , you do n't understand {this} [498] .If you do {this} [498] , you 'll stir up more trouble , and then wo n't your dad be even worse off ?In fact when {they} [496] said that , my mind had already eased .I could not lose the face this way , , So then I ran over and took a whack at {the door} [499] , to get an excuse for {myself} [497] .Was it all ruined ? {The door} [499] --I slashed {it} [499] twice .Um , was n't there any consequence ?Mm , there was no consequence , , I just let the adults reason with {me} [497] .Mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .It , had a great influence on {me} [497] .Including that village , that environment , it 's all very familiar to you .More or less , very close to {me} [497] , this is a novel of .Mm {.Mm} [500] ., the reason I like {it} [501] is because , um , {it} [501] brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories .Mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in {Beijing} [469] .What year was it that you moved to {Shanghai} [502] ?How old were you at that time ?, In '69 I was 11 years old .Mm .Mm , well .In '69 at the age of 11 you went from {Beijing} [469] to {Shanghai} [502] .Mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n't completely passed .Mm , {as} [503] {he} [503] puts {it} [503] , looking at {it} [503] now , {some of the memories} [504]{the memories} [470] can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .I went there every day and then {they} [504] suspended classes , , so I could n't go to school , could n't go to class .Mm .So , later I remember there was -- {Mm} [505] . A guy in {the engineering team} [506] , and {he} [507] brought {Quotations} [508] from {Chairman Mao} [509] and said to me , {He} [507] said , now take this , now take {these Quotations} [508] from {Chairman Mao} [509] and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .A {lot of people} [510] were very happy , very excited , because {they} [510] were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?Right , but the problem --Because , I had never studied well ,In 1966 {the Great Cultural Revolution} [475] came , and at that time {Ye Daying} [467]{Ye Daying 's} [467] family moved from {Beijing} [469] to {Shanghai} [502] to live .His {father Ye Zhengming} [476] was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .And the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of {Ye Daying} [467]{Ye Daying 's} [467] life .He was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .When you got to {Shanghai} [502] the environment changed ; did n't your whole person change ?After I got to {Shanghai} [502] , , settling into , , that ,All that time , from '69 to '76 , I graduated from {senior middle school} [511] , it all took place there .Mm .At that time in school , there were some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in {that class} [512] ?Right , right , , see , like study classes to educate good kids .What kind of people were in {your class} [512] ?Um .Anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say {they} [513] were little hooligans , {they} [513] were all mixed in together in {that class} [512] , and there were also some who had problems at home .Mm .All of {them} [513] , and every day I went there , and {the classes} [514] were suspended , , so {they} [514] did n't let me go to school , did n't let me go to class .Mm .So , afterward , I remember there was {Mm} [515] . A guy in {the engineering team} [506] , and {he} [516] brought Quotations from {Chairman Mao} [509] and said to me , {He} [516] said , now take this , now take {these Quotations} [508] from {Chairman Mao} [509] and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .Lots of fun .Mm .So I was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .In fact it was n't that {we} [517] did n't study , I think it was ,{This class} [512] really helped me a lot , , sometimes in my life I think about this ,Mm .That period was {both} [518] a happy and a fun time .Because I was a good egg .In this I go against the grain .Um , the thing is , , {they} [518] 're all the same .If you 're bad , you do what you want , and so , you 're honest and so it 's easy to be free .Plus when you yourself have already decided that you 're a bad kid , then , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you 're completely liberated and free .I think that --Um , of course today {we} [517] say , at that time , um , in that class of {ours} [517] , they were n't all necessarily bad kids .Mm .They just were n't like normal kids ., it was like a brotherhood .Ah , and {we} [517] did some things that were out of bounds .Mm , {we} [517] helped each other .Very sincere , very sincere and good .When {he} [519] was in {that class} [512] , {Ye Daying} [520] received patient teaching every day .At that time {he} [519] encountered the first love of {his} [519] life that still remains fresh in {his} [519] memory .This girl became the only light in {Ye Daying 's} [467]{Ye Daying} [520] 's dark life for several years .In those days if {a middle school student} [521] liked a fellow - student , how did {he} [521] go about expressing that ?Um .When I was a school kid , for example , Um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , I liked {her} [522] .Mm .I always felt , um , {she} [522] can , give you more on {your plate} [523] , put more things on {your plate} [523] for you to eat .And then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together .Mm .It was ,So already you could -- Go see {a movie} [524] ; I thought ,That was it , that was it .You just want to go see {the movie} [524] , you do n't worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , --So you went to {the movies with this girl} [525]{this girl} [522] ?Yes .Do you still remember {what movies} [525] you saw ?{The Flower Girl} [522] .I still remember that now .Mm .She cried as hard as {she} [522] could .So seeing {The Flower Girl} [522] was the equivalent of seeing Titanic now .Oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .Yes , crying {her} [522]{her eyes} [526] out , a big film like that .At the time I thought I would n't cry .But the people all around were crying , and I thought {if} [527] I did n't cry {it} [527] would look bad .So then you cried .So then I thought , I should let my emotions go .Um , how was {the girl} [522] , was {she} [522] very pretty ?, now I remember that {she} [522] was very pretty , mm {.Mm} [500] .She was a very good student .Ha ha , this --How was it {she} [522] liked you ?At that time {we} [528] did n't talk about it , if two people gave each other {the eye} [529] and felt {it} [529] was right , then ,Gave each other {the eye} [529] , while you were in the class you gave each other {the eye} [529] ., so , when {we} [528] were in class , for example you ,I remember how it happened , yes .Um . When {we} [528] went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .Mm .Mm .So then , {we} [528] 'd each pick up a piece of {chalk} [530] and toss {the chalk} [530] back and forth . And throw spitballs .I threw {it} [530] at someone else but missed , and {it} [530] hit {her} [522] .The result was that {she} [522] turned {her} [522] head to look .And {she} [522] looked at you angrily .I thought , uh-oh , the expression in {her} [522]{her eyes} [526] was like {she} [522] would forgive you , that kind of feeling .I thought wow , it 's so wonderful , that kind of feeling .Mm .That 's how it was , I should say .It was like that ?Mm .Many years later , afterward , we graduated from {senior middle school} [511] , and I was still going to see {her} [522] .Mm .The --, so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .You graduated from middle school in '73 .'74 .Mm .Graduated from midle school in '74 .Mm , that female schoolmate went to the {Shanghai} [502] suburbs to live and work .Right , right , yes .Ye {Daying} [520] went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were , forty - some yuan ?{Mm} [505] , when I started {it} [531] was a technical school .Then at first {it} [531] was 13 yuan , the first year 13 yuan ; the second year {it} [531] was 15 yuan , and the third year {it} [531] was 41 yuan .Mm .Mm {.41 yuan} [532] , at the time , for {him} [532] , it was , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money .It was a lot of money .In 1976 , there were two happy events in {the Ye family} [533] .The first was that {his} [534] father , Ye Zhengming , was released and reunited with {his family} [533]{his} [534] family that {he} [534] had been separated from for three years .The second event was that {Ye Daying} [520] had {his} [520] 18th birthday and became an adult .With the turn for the better in {his} [520] father 's political circumstances , {Ye Daying} [520] left behind {his} [520] violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking .In 1978 the big news was that {the college entrance exams} [535] would be reinstated nationwide , and people of {Ye Daying} [520]{Ye Daying 's} [520] age were thrilled .However , at this time {Ye Daying} [520] , facing this opportunity that would change {his} [520] fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .You thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?Oh my , in fact , '78 , for {me} [536] , was an especially depressing time .Mm .Mm .Up to then , um , I had never thought about the future .Mm .I thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -LRB- factory -RRB- worker .In society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead .Um , in {'78} [537] suddenly they reinstated {the college entrance exams} [535] .At that time , in {'78} [537] , I was 20 .A {lot of people} [538] were happy , very excited , because {they} [538] reinstated {the college entrance exams} [535] ; why were you feeling depressed ?Right , but the problem was , , Because , I had never done well in school .So right off I felt that I was finished , {--Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school} [539] , , compared to {me} [536] , {they} [539] had a future , um , {they} [539] could stand out .Mm .So I was hopeless , right off I was feeling down .Very clearly a --If you wanted to take {the exams} [535] , what kind of score did you think you 'd get .I did n't take {the exams} [535] , I did n't have the nerve , I did n't try , so --, the extraordinary thing was , at that time {my mom} [540] was attending {the film institute} [541] , {she} [540] was an instructor there .Mm .Mm , I had n't thought , , that I would work in the movie .Mm ., um , {she} [540] wanted to send the recruitment announcement to {a friend 's house} [542] .Mm .So then I --One day {she} [540] sent me to deliver {it} [542] , and so I picked {it} [542] up and read {it} [542] , and once I read {it} [542] , oh ! The directing department of {the film institute} [541] , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and I thought wow ! This is just the ticket .Let 's run off to try and see .I thought you 've loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , I want to be a director .No , I did n't , no .It was just because there was no English exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .Right , it was very simple .Mm .One more thing , because in '78 , {the Beijing Film Institute} [543] was recruiting students in {Shanghai} [502] --Right .So , {Ye Daying} [520] went to take {the exams for the film institute} [544]{the film institute} [541] , but did n't pass {the exams} [544] .His mother , An Qi , had never thought that {Ye Daying} [520] would sign up to take {the exam} [545] for {her} [520] work unit , {the Beijing Film Institute} [543] .But {Ye Daying} [520] in fact failed when {he} [520] took {the reinstated exam} [545] .Although it was the first time {he} [520] had taken {the exam} [545] , {it} [545] left {Ye Daying} [520] even more convinced that movies were something {he} [520] could do .The next year , 21 - year - old Ye Daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at {the Xi'an Film Studio} [546] .Being {an actor} [547] was not {his} [547] goal ; {he} [547] hoped rather to get into the directing profession .At that time you especially admired directors , right ?{Mm} [515] , because after I got to {the Xi'an Film Studio} [546] , um , I discovered I had {the shakes} [548] when I got on stage .Mm .Mm . Now , here chatting with you , I feel , um , it does n't matter .Even today , in front of the lens , I 'm a nervous wreck .Mm , very tense .Did you act then ?Of course , every day we had to , um , it was n't just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that .I thought , this is definitely not working .Just getting on stage gave you {the shakes} [548] .Then , , no , it was n't my thing , this , I could n't find out why , and besides in those days ,Um , it was in '80 that I went to the Xi'an Film Studio ,Mm .At that time , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing .And I 'm not that kind of person , so I could n't get my bearings .So then at the same time when I saw that {Teng Wenji} [549] , {he} [549] was probably thirty - some years old , {he} [549] was the previous generation to us , very stubborn .Mm .Mm .That projecting force of {his} [549] , I thought wow , , that 's really good .He could really project .Because ultimately , there , I gradually realized this .Mm .And I would be in the audience and see {him} [549] directing on site .Mm .Mm , I could see how they worked .In fact in the beginning the attraction to movies was all these things , I thought it was really a bunch of fluff , I thought , that 's really fun , that 's really interesting .I thought who was stubborn , then I wanted to be that kind of person , but that did n't mean I knew anything about that profession .So no one ever came looking for you to do a play ?At that time --Mm , no one ever came looking -- .They looked , but it was always just for an extra ., you did n't even have any lines .Mm .That Xi'an Incident thing , I played an extra once .There was a guy playing Zhang Xueliang , and I played {his} [550] secretary going in to report to {him} [550] , and I did it a few times but I was always in the wrong place .What were your lines supposed to be ?It was \" reporting , a telegram \" that sort of thing .So you --So I had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful .So after I gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing .So the old director , Cheng Yin , um ,Mm .He would say , this is {An Qi 's son} [551] , why is {he} [551] like that ?Do you remember how many takes you did ?Oh , a lot .I think it was something like ten plus times .It was too , I 'd walk badly and turn like that ., I attended {that class} [512] for half a year , um , um and then I got sick .Um , I got , , an inflammation of {the central nervous system} [552] , so {my whole body} [553] was paralyzed .Your {whole body} [553] was paralyzed ?Right .Your {whole body} [553] was paralyzed ?Right . I was paralyzed for ten months .So you could n't move at all .I could n't move at all .When {it} [553] started , my leg went numb , then {my hand} [554] went numb , and then {it} [554] started cross over , like that , and then slowly , slowly , slowly I could n't move .What 's the scientific name of {the disease} [555] ?{It} [555] 's called Guillain - Barre Syndrome .It 's named after a foreigner .Mm .Ahem , if naming {it} [555] somewhat common , it 's , a paralysis of {the central nervous system} [552] , um , {it} [555] goes from the nerve endings to the flesh , and , then {it} [555] turns into myasthenia .And how did you get better , later ?Hormones .You took hormones .Um , , every day I had a transfusion .Mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat .Mm .Very fat .I 'm so fat now , but compared to then it 's much better , in fact .At that time how fat were you ?Yah .Getting so fat , it was this , if I looked down I could see {my own cheeks} [556] , so I thought I was really fat .What do you mean ?{If} [557] I just look down , {my cheeks} [556] are right here .But after {they} [557] finished with the hormones , I gradually got better .Mm .The flesh all atrophied , um .If you look at when I was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --Later , based on that , it all evaporated .I 've heard it said that that Wang Shuo novel , which we later saw as a television play --Sometimes , oh , right .Mm .Get some fun .Get some fun .The language in that , the part {Wang Zhiwen} [558] played , the disease {he} [558] got is about the same as your disease , is n't it ?Right , right , right , right .So sometimes , oh , it was me and {Wang Shuo} [559] , together , it was , um , in '89 .Mm , together , um , wrote a -- .Aye , the script I wanted , the novel {he} [558] wrote , um , that piece {we} [560] created together .Mm {.Therefore} [561] , at {that time} [562] , {we} [560] were talking and talking to shoot , an urban love story , tell a love story , so {he} [561] took me , at {that time} [562] , , more or less that story , as background .Mm .Then after I went back to Beijning , when {we} [560] made arrangement and were eating together , I saw {Wang Shuo} [559] for the first timeThen , when I saw {him} [559] for the first time , {Wang Shuo} [559] was holding a book in {his} [559] arms , a book , that was Floating on the Sea , that novel {he} [559] wrote , {it} [563] was a sample .Mm .Gave {it} [563] to {me} [559] , and I took {it} [563] back to school to read .I read {it} [563] and wow , that day , I thought {he} [559] would be able --Our generation could really find {ourselves} [564] , I mean --Um , in the end I knew {we} [564] --Why {we} [564] studied movies , um , and why wrote things , expressing one 's own kind of thing is the most accurate personYe {Daying} [520] had already read {Wang Shuo} [559]{Wang Shuo 's} [559] novel Love the Hard Way , and the story and the style it was written in made a profound impression on {him} [559] .He sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express .Later {he} [559] was introduced by a friend , and {Ye Daying} [520] met the author of the novel , {Wang Shuo} [559] , at {the film institute} [541] .That was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today .How many plays did you collaborate on ?Today , {U.S.} [565] Secretary of Defense William Cohen promised to catch and punish those responsible for {the bombing of the `` Cole ''} [566]{the `` Cole ''} [567] and defended the Navy 's decision to refuel ships in {Yemen} [568] as {investigators} [569] continued {their} [569] day at work .Morton {Dean} [570] reports it 's a difficult day for the sailors remaining on board .The stressful , monumental task for the crew on the U.S. carrier suffered a setback .The ship began to take on water and lost electrical power again .A difficult time became even more difficult .It led to the cancellation of a memorial service planned for the 17 sailors who lost their lives .Details are becoming known about the damage , most obvious , the huge hole , but also the deck is buckled .Even the superstructure is damaged .Hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed .Rear Admiral Mark Fitzgerald , who visited {the Cole} [567] , was stunned by the damage .I wo n't tell you whether {the ship} [567] is going to sink or not sink , but there was considerable damage to {the ship} [567] .According to {U.S.} [565] officials here {tonight} [571] , the most important questions about {the attack} [572] remain unanswered .Any details or speculation on who specifically , we do n't know that at this point .With well over 100 {U.S.} [565] investigators now in {Yemen} [568] , the search for evidence is now fully under way .It 's been officially designated `` Operation Determined Response , '' and that suggests several things that {the U.S.} [565] , of course , is determined to discover who carried out {the bombing} [566] and that any group who helped plan {the attack} [572] faces a response from the U.S. military .The {U.S.} [565] believes there are anti-American terror groups based in {Yemen} [568] .Half the population lives in settlements with 500 people or less , and senior {U.S.} [565] officials here say {the government} [568] , although friendly to {the United States} [573] , does not have full control over {the entire country} [568] {.Yemen 's President} [574] has repeatedly said an internal explosion rocked {the `` USS Cole} [575] , '' but tomorrow {U.S.} [565] officials expect {him} [574] to announce that {he} [574] has changed {his} [574] mind , and tomorrow , the search for bodies will resume .Ten {U.S.} [565] sailors are still missing .Morton {Dean} [570] , {Yemen} [568] .To learn more about {Yemen} [568] , go to our website at abcnews.com .The remains of four sailors killed in {the `` USS Cole '' bombing} [566] returned to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware today .They were the last of the dead to be flown home , but in {Yemen} [568] , the search for those responsible for {the bombing} [566] continues .Investigators turned up new evidence and more leads today .ABC 's {John Miller} [576] reports .Investigators have searched at least half a dozen homes around the port of {Aden} [577] including this one , trying to retrace the movements of what they believe may be six or more suspects .This {house on Al Zaharah Street} [578] half a mile from the port is where investigators believe {the bomb} [579] was built into the boat that carried {it} [579] .Just after {the men} [580] moved in , {neighbors} [581] say {they} [580] erected a metal corrugated wall to block {the neighbors '} [581] view of the yard .Investigators say {the men who lived here} [580] worked on {the boat} [582] behind these walls in the last few days of {their} [580] stay almost constantly .At first , {neighbors} [583] were curious , but later {they} [583] complained about the noise .On the day of {the bombing} [566] , neighbors saw {the boat} [582] leaving through these gates pulled by a Nissan 4 x 4 truck .The trip from {the house} [578] to the harbor was only about a mile , then six miles by water to the spot where the American destroyer was refueling .Today , {FBI agents and divers} [584] were collecting evidence near the place {they} [584] believe {the boat} [582] was lowered into the water just before {the attack on the `` USS Cole '' which killed 17 sailors and two suicide bombers .Investigators} [585]{the `` USS Cole ''} [586] which killed 17 sailors and {two suicide bombers} [587] .Investigators have come up with a series of names of possible suspects found on papers in the houses and cars {they} [585] searched .In {some cases} [588] , {they} [588] have some names .They have not been able to verify {whether} [589] {they} [589] 're accurate , true names .In {other cases} [590] , I do n't believe {they} [590] have identities yet .Yemeni sources say some of {the bombers} [587] may have used ID cards issued by a government registration center 35 miles from {Aden} [577] .Today , at the walled - in headquarters of the government security agency , the manager of that center and several clerks who worked there were among dozens who have been detained and questioned .Investigators are aware that a few weeks before {the bombing} [566] , accused {terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden} [591] released a videotape calling for holy war against Americans in the Gulf .American {investigators} [592] also say the way {the bombers} [587] organized the plot in {Aden} [577] has stark similarities to the way {Bin Laden} [591]{Bin Laden 's} [591] cells have operated in the past , but , {they} [592] concede , while {they} [592] are closer to learning the names of {the bombers} [587] , {they} [592] are still a long way from knowing or proving who sent {them} [592] .John {Miller} [576] , {ABC News} [593] , {Aden} [577] .We have an exclusive report tonight about {the `` USS Cole} [575] , '' and an identical attack that was planned , but failed , several months earlier .Here 's {ABC} [594]{ABC 's John M Wethy .ABC} [595] {News} [593] has learned that the terrorists who attacked {the `` USS Cole ''} [586]{`` USS Cole ''} [567] originally planned to hit a different American warship in the same port ten months earlier .The attack was to be part of a worldwide effort during celebration of the millennium that included targets in Jordan and Seattle .Intelligence sources say the target was to be a destroyer , the `` USS The Sullivans , '' which refueled in {Yemen} [568] 's port of {Aden} [577] in January .Sources tell {ABC News} [593] that {a suspect who has been in custody for several weeks} [596] told Yemeni investigators that {his} [596]{his group} [597] failed in {their attack} [572]{their} [597] attack because {their} [597] small boat , overloaded with explosives , sank just off the beach .The {suspect} [596] said it took months to repackage and redesign the load of high explosives that was eventually used against `` the Cole . ''{John M Wethy} [595] , {ABC News} [593] , the Pentagon .Good evening .That call to order you just heard reverberates through {the Supreme Court} [598] every day that the justices convene , but today was no everyday session .Never before has {the United States Supreme Court} [598] taken up a case that could decide a presidential election .It did today .That session of {the Supreme Court} [598] and two defeats for {Al Gore} [599] in {Florida} [600] courts dominate the news today .We start with {the U.S. Supreme Court} [598] , specifically at issue , an appeal from {the campaign of George W.

Bush} [602] that {the Florida Supreme Court} [598] had exceeded {its} [598]{its authority} [603] when {it} [598] ruled {Florida} [600] counties could have more time to hand - count ballots .Throughout an hour and a half of argument , {the justices} [604] were aggressive in peppering lawyers with questions , and {they} [604] seemed interested on two issues .Was there a federal issue involved that would even require {the U.S. Supreme Court} [598] to rule ? and if so , did {the Florida Supreme Court} [598] improperly rewrite {Florida} [600] law , as {Governor Bush} [602] contends ?A sure sign of the historic nature of the day 's proceeding , for the first time ever , {the court} [598] immediately released an audiotape of the arguments .But in the courtroom , listening in person was {ABC} [594]{ABC 's Jackie Judd} [605] .Even now , hours after that hearing ended , there are still {protesters circling the Supreme Court} [606]{the Supreme Court} [598] .As boisterous as {the protesters} [606] were , {nothing intruded on the ritual inside .The chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States .The courtroom} [607]{the United States} [573] .The courtroom was packed .Al {Gore} [599] 's top campaign aides , {his} [599] children , Republican senators and congressmen , {they} [607] were all there .God save {the United States} [573] and {this honorable court} [598] .First up , {Ted Olson} [608] lawyer for {George W. Bush} [602] , laying out {the campaign} [601] 's main claim .Olson made it through only 56 seconds of {his} [608] arguments before a justice broke in .Well , Mr. Olson --Sandra Day O'Connor , often the swing vote on {this court} [598] , demanded to know why {the court} [598] even had a role in this case .Olson argued that a century - old federal statute prevents laws governing an election from being created after the fact which , {he} [608] claimed , is just what {the Florida court} [598]{Florida} [600] court did , and also , that {the U.S. Constitution} [609] gives state legislatures , not the courts , the right to choose electors .Of {all the justices} [604] it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg who seemed most sympathetic to {the Florida Supreme Court} [598] .Midway through the hearing , {Chief Justice Rehnquist} [610] seemed to scold {his} [610] colleagues for being too talkative when {he} [610] made an unusual offer to {the lawyer representing Florida 's Attorney General} [611]{Florida} [600] 's Attorney General .And so it went on .Laurence Tribe , {Gore} [599] 's attorney , said {the state court} [598] did nothing illegal .It simply provided a way for a close election to be examined .Justice O'Connor again , but this time suggesting {the state court} [598] had overstepped {its} [598]{its authority} [603] and perhaps there was a federal case here .Justice Antonin Scalia also pressed Tribe .He said {the state court} [598] relied on {the Florida Constitution} [609] to draft {its} [609] decision , excluding state lawmakers and that violated {the U.S. Constitution} [609] .It was Justice Breyer who asked the most straightforward question of all .What happens if {the court} [598] rules in favor of {Bush} [602] ?The answer from {the Secretary of State 's lawyer} [611] was , {Bush} [602] wins and all the litigation in {Florida} [600] ends .Not everyone agrees .They say that no matter which way {the court} [598] rules , {it} [598] will not provide nearly so much finality to {this presidential election} [612] .Charlie ?{Jackie Judd} [605] at {the Supreme Court} [598] .Our thanks .The {`` USS Cole ''} [567] has arrived back at the Mississippi shipyard where {she} [567] was built .ABC 's John M. Wethy reports {tonight} [571] before the attack on {the ship} [567] , the crew failed to take at least 25 % of the 80 different steps to protect {the ship} [567] before landing in {Yemen} [568] .An investigation is already under way .The ship 's captain is going to take a lot of heat for the 17 sailors who died .The ship will sail again .After {George W.

''Thanks for joining {us} [617] .Here 's {our} [617] story this half hour --There 's dancing in the streets of {Belgrade} [618] as angry demonstrations have turned into celebrations .Tens of thousands of people crowded the streets of the Yugoslavian capital today after the apparent overthrow of {President Slobodan Milosevic} [619] .Yesterday , protesters stormed key government buildings and seized Serb state television in {Belgrade} [618] .Russia has joined {the West} [620] in {its} [620] support of {opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica} [621] .Russian {Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov} [622] congratulated {Kostunica} [621] on {his} [622] election victory .He also gave {him} [622] a letter from {Russian} [623] President Vladimir Putin .Putin says {he} [622] hopes {the opposition leader} [622] will do `` everything possible to overcome the internal political crisis '' in {Yugoslavia} [624] .Russia was the last European power to withhold support for the opposition .The man who lost power in {Yugoslavia} [624] finally surfaced today .Slobodan {Milosevic} [619] met with {Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov} [622]{Russian} [623] Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov .Ivanov says {Milosevic} [619] told {him} [619] {he} [619] plans to remain in {Serbia} [625] and continue to run {its} [625]{its largest political party} [626] .Indeed {Milosevic} [619] still considers {himself} [619] to be President , according to {his} [619]{his brother Borislav} [627] .In an interview with {CNN} [628] , {Borislav Milosevic} [619] accused Western nations of supporting the demonstrations and said {his} [619]{his brother} [627] has no plans to leave the city .Regardless of how many votes {Mr. Kostunica} [621] received , the actions that took place last night are vandalism .It 's violence .It should n't have happened .That 's not democracy .The opposition did n't accept {the ruling of the constitutional court} [629]{the constitutional court} [598] and began to storm the parliament , which was not being defended , and inflicted huge material damage , but {it} [629] also did more damage to our institutions .The next step in the transition to a new government is for the Yugoslav parliament to convene .A commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to {Belgrade} [618] for a special session .Alessio Vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of parliament will have to travel to {Belgrade} [618] from Montenegro .What is going on right now is intense negotiations with all the members of parliament that were elected on September trying to get the majority needed in order to swear in {Vojislav Kostunica} [621] as the next President of {Yugoslavia} [624] .With the events of the past week in {Yugoslavia} [624] , the world is getting to know the name of {Vojislav Kostunica} [621] .Jonathan {Mann} [630] takes a look at the man and {his} [630] politics .Unlike {President Milosevic} [619] , {he} [619] was not a Communist in the long years when party membership was the key to power .He was not among the prominent opposition figures who have struggled against each other almost as hard as {the regime} [631] .He is an orthodox Serb nationalist , but {he} [619] supports truer democracy for {his} [619]{his country} [624] and better relations with {its} [624] neighbors and {the West .Kostunica} [632] is a soft - spoken and uncharismatic figure who spent years building {the Democratic Party of Serbia} [626]{Serbia} [625] and gathering only modest support .After ten years , people know what are the differences between {Milosevic} [619] 's policies and ours , what {Milosevic} [619] was saying and promising and what the opposition parties and I myself was saying in these years and how I was behaving {.Kostunica} [632] is 56 , an expert on constitutional law who lives with {his} [619] wife and pets in a {Belgrade} [618] apartment {.He} [633] was fired from {his} [633] job teaching law in 1974 for {his} [633] opposition to the policies of the Tito government .He refused an offer to return in 1989 because of {his} [633]{his opposition to the Milosevic regime} [634]{the Milosevic regime} [631]{Milosevic} [619] regime , and {he} [633] rejects much from {the West} [620] as well -- the Dayton peace accord , Western sanctions on {Yugoslavia} [624] , and the war crimes tribunal .In the months before {the election} [612] , {he} [633] was careful to distinguish between {his} [633] support for European aid projects tied to reform and {U.S.} [635] efforts , which {he} [633] describes as unhelpful , even to {the opposition} [634] .I know what the support means when we get from European Union , the programs like energy for democracy , school for democracy .Those small projects .Here {we get nothing in advance , just a political support which consists of nothing , and which is mostly used and abused and manipulated by the regime} [636]{the regime} [631] , saying {they} [636] are just NATO parties , as is often said by regime , {they} [636] are not having {their} [636] own policy .Jonathan {Mann} [630] , {CNN} [628]{CNN .We} [628] 'll be following the events in {Yugoslavia} [624] all day .To learn more about the situation , just click on our website at headlinenews.com .The {United Nations Security Council} [637] has passed a resolution condemning what {it} [637] calls `` acts of violence , especially the excessive use of force against {Palestinians} [638] .

handling of the SARs epidemic and of {the country} [714] 's health care system .China requires {foreign broadcasters} [790] to use a Chinese satellite to serve {their country} [714]{their} [790] country .Until last month it was routinely blocking almost all reports about Sars in {China} [791] , a practice that has produced intense global criticism .The {British Broadcasting Company} [792] has also faced the censorship in {China} [791] .In 1993 {Rupert Murdoch} [793] bought a controlling stake in {China} [791] 's Star TV satellite system .In 1994 the BBC World Service broadcasts were pulled from Star .China was offended by {the BBC 's news content} [794] and demanded that {STAR TV} [795] remove {it} [794] or lose permission to broadcast in {China} [791] .A year later {Murdoch} [793] bought the rest of {Star TV} [795] that he did not own .Rupert {Murdoch} [793] 's News Corp. has an extensive presence , of course in {this country} [791] .That presence may be expanding soon , if {the FCC} [796] eases some of {its} [796] broadcast rules {.Murdoch} [797] has lobbied hard for those changes .They would allow {him} [797] to buy even more {U.S.} [761] television stations .Next month {the FCC} [796]{FCC} [796] is likely to accommodate {him} [797] .Murdoch today promised that if the rules are changed {he} [797] will limit future purchases to a few of what {he} [797] calls sizable markets .Let 's talk a little bit more about what {the Navy} [798] does to prevent such tragedies .We were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .I 'll try to explain it the best I can from what I remember from being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln '' .This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what {the Navy} [798] does with regard to prevention ., every sailor that 's entering {the Navy} [798] does take a swim test .They learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .Also drills take place before {sailors} [799] get on to any ship , before any deployment .Usually twice a day , {they} [799] 're practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed {a man} [800] overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , {those} [801] wane off , but {they} [801] know where to go quickly .They also wear float coats .You can see {them} [801] here .The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .Everything is color coordinated .You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and {they} [801] have toggles to pull and inflate .They also have {a manual device} [802] so if the toggles do n't work {they} [801] can blow air into {the inflation device} [802] .They have dive goggles and {they} [801] 're able to find {them} [801] .It also has a strobe light and a whistle .Also such location devices , some ships have smoke floats they can toss out so {the man} [800] overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to , let the rescuer locate them .Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout {the ship} [779] , all around {the ship} [779] , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of {the ship} [779] , not all around {the entire ship} [779] , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .Now let 's talk about {the man overboard rescue} [800] and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .You will hear a P.A. announcement around {the entire ship} [779] , there is a man overboard so {everyone} [803] knows {they} [803] have to react quickly .A {ship - wide search} [804] will happen if {they} [804] do n't see that person go overboard , but if indeed {they} [804] do see someone go overboard , {the ship} [779] starts to circle that area continuously .Also small boats sometimes go out into {the water} [805] , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .Inside {those helicopters rescue swimmers} [806] .If indeed {the man overboard} [800] is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .If {the man overboard} [800] is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely {those swimmers} [806] will go right into {the water} [805] and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull {them} [806] up into the helo and pull {them} [806] back on to {the ship for treatment} [807] and usually {a search} [808] takes about 24 hours .The search crews will go 24 hours before calling off {that search} [808] .Why call {it} [807] off ?There 's a number of reasons to look at .Depending on the water temperature , it 's very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is {they} [809] fail {they} [809] 've exhausted all resources by that time .Anyway , we 'll continue to follow what 's happening on the `` USS Nassau '' as {those investigations} [810] continue for the two missing sailors .Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas scheduled to meet today , {their} [810] second chance now to discuss the {Bush} [811] administration 's road map for {Mideast} [812] peace .Both sides will meet with {President Bush} [811] when {he} [811] arrives in {the Mideast} [812]{Mideast} [812] next week .Our Jerusalem bureau chief Mike Hanna standing by with more and that .Mike ?In {the African nation of Nigeria} [813] , an Islamic court delayed the appeal of a woman condemned to death by stoning .The {court} [814] says {it} [814] will not hear this case until late August .The 31 - year - old mother of three was convicted in March of having sex outside of marriage .Three other Nigerians also face stoning deaths for the same crime .The prosecution of premarital or extramarital sex is not quite as rare as you might think .Our next guest this morning faced 100 lashes for premarital sex in Pakistan .She was there as a journalist in the wake of the 9 / 11 attacks .She has written about {her} [815] experience in the book `` Tantrika '' Traveling the Road of Divine Love .A traveling reporter now on leave and joins {us} [816] to tell {her} [815] story .Thank you for coming in to share this with {us} [816] .As I understand it , you say you were facing a sentence of 100 lashes , had not yet been sentenced that ?Back in this city , a courthouse in Manhattan .Sam Waksal , founder and {former CEO of ImClone} [817]{ImClone} [818] is scheduled to be sentenced today .He pleaded guilty earlier this year to insider trading , bank fraud and tax evasion .Waksal could be fined $ 3.5 million , facing a maximum of 75 years in prison , expected , though , to receive about six to seven years .That 's the early indication we 've been given .A {friend of his , Martha Stewart} [819] , pleaded not guilty last week .The charges related to {her} [819] sale of {ImClone} [818] stock .She sold the share a day before bad news about {the company} [792] sent the stock price falling , considerably .Sam Waksal , sentenced , 10:00 a.m. , local time here in {New York} [820]{New York .Freddie Mac} [821] is giving golden parachutes to two of {its} [821] ousted executives .Our Rhonda Schaffler is near New York Stock Exchange with the latest on {this unfolding story} [781] , certainly one we have been hearing a lot about .Reporter :That 's right .There 's a new development out .This particular scandal has really captivated Wall Street this month .Before I tell you how big those parachutes are , let me tell you what {the U.S. Treasury Secretary} [822] is saying about it now .John Snow making some comments a short time ago saying {he} [822] backs tougher oversight for {the company} [792] .He also says {his} [822]{his department} [823] is trying to determine if {it} [823] has implication for {the nation} [813] 's financial system .Freddie {Mac} [821] stock is down another 6.5 % today .It has lost more than 207 % -- or about 20 % since Monday .Monday , of course , is when {the company} [792] fired {its} [792]{its President} [811] for not cooperating with efforts to restate earnings for the last few years .Freddie {Mac} [821] 's Chairman and CEO forced out the same day .Investors learned last night {the CEO} [817] is getting a severance package worth $ 24 million .The {ousted President} [811] is going to walk away with more than $ 6 million in vested openings .Yesterday Federal Prosecutions announced a criminal probe into {the company} [792] .Probably tough number for the rest of the company employees to hear .I want to ask you a little bit about cell phones now .All of {us} [824] use {our} [824] phones , I think , maybe too much .The companies that {we} [824] pay for probably love it .Who talks more ?Men or --Off the coast there was a dramatic rescue by a cruise ship ship .Canada TV has the story and some dramatic pictures .Reporter :With winds bliping at more than 100 kilometers an hour , {three men} [825] desperately cling to {their} [825] sinking fishing boat .The crew sent out {a distress call} [826] after {it} [826] started taking on water .Suddenly {we} [824] realized {water} [827] came into {the engine room} [828] and {it} [828] was rising and {they} [829] started to pump , of course , and {they} [829] pumped and pumped and {the water} [827] came more and more and more .Reporter :{The ship} [779] was sinking by the second , and as the waves pounded against {them} [829] , waiting for help was {their} [829] only option .Their life raft had already been snitched away by {the high seas} [830] .When {we} [824] got {the information} [831] , {it} [831] was only 23 , 25 miles off , so {we} [824] were quite close .Reporter :Still it took the Royal Caribbean cruise ship `` Raidience of {the Seas} [830] '' almost an hour to reach the scene and despite the rough ocean , {the captain} [832] immediately sent {a boat} [833] in to save {them} [834] .They see {them} [834] .They see {them} [834] .They were jumping in the sea when {they} [834] saw the rescuers were on the way .They were swimming toward {the boat} [833] .I pulled out {the youngest guy} [835] first and then I wanted to pull out {the captain} [832] , but {the captain} [832] said take --Dog Chapman was in the same truck you saw .At one point , {the Mexican police} [836] busted both {Andrew Luster} [837] and Dwayne Dog Chapman , because {they} [836] do n't like bounty hunters in {Mexico} [838] .Chapman remains behind bars as we speak in {Mexico} [838] .Andrew {Luster} [837] , though arrived yesterday at Los Angeles International Airport on a commercial flight from {Mexico} [838] .As soon as {he} [835] arrived -- thoom being walked by the FBI to a van belonging to the Ventura County sheriff 's folks .He was taken to a prison in Kearn County , California , about 100 miles from {Los Angeles} [839] , a place mostly known for its grapes .Make of that what you may .Heidi ?Going to use it in those patients .His {dandruff shampoo} [840] was n't tough enough for Black , so I bought {him} [840] maximum strength {Selsun Blue} [841] .It 's doctor recommended and works fast .Selsun {Blue .That} [841] have riveted {the nation} [813] .First , a big hearing tomorrow in the Scott Peterson case .Punishing prosecutors .It could all be up for grabs .Then the Texas woman accused of hitting {a man} [842] with {her} [843] car , driving home with {him} [842] stuck to {her} [843] windshield and leaving {him} [842] there to die .And Andrew Luster , grandson of cosmetic legend Max Factor , what drove {him} [842] to become a serial rapist and to jump bail in the middle of {the trial} [844] , only to be captured in {Mexico} [838] by a bounter hunter after five months on the Roun .That 's all next on `` {Larry King} [845] Live . ''We begin first with the extraordinary case of {Andrew Luster} [837] , and the guests are here in {Los Angeles} [839] , Roger John Diamond , {he} [845] is {Andrew Luster} [837]{Andrew Luster 's} [837] attorney , in Chicago , the well known {Bill Curtis} [846] .The special report will air tonight at 10:00 Eastern , A Twisted Mind , The Andrew Luster Story on A&E produced by CBS News Productions for A&E and {Bill Curtis} [846] is the producer and director .In {New York} [820] is Nancy Grace , a former prosecutor , in Atlanta Chris Picksly , defense attorney , and in {New York} [820] , Dr. Michael Wellner who published the research study on drug facilitated rapists .He 's a professor of psychiatry at NYU , chairman of the forensic panel and fellow of the depravity scale that considers sensational crimes for sentencing {.He} [847] was arrested in June after {he} [847] -- jumped trial on bail .It will be one of the first election returns on Tuesday .It will also be among the most important .As {we} [848] continue {our} [848] coverage of presidential politics with a look at the last - minute battle to win a crucial swing state , Florida .25 electoral votes .It 's being fought over hard .With a look at how the candidates are getting out the vote there , here 's {NBC News} [849]{NBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders} [850] .The image of {Florida} [851] , both fact and fiction .A great getaway , a state where a mouse wields more power than a tropical paradise .While the mild winters make this comfortable living for almost three million seniors , the largest elderly population in {the United States} [852] , {this year} [853] {it} [853] is not the weather drawing {Al Gore} [854] and George W. Bush to the Sunshine State .Both candidates list 25 reasons to keep coming back , {Florida} [851] 's 25 electoral votes .Polls show {Florida} [851] is still up for grabs .Both {candidates} [855] have been here almost equally .In fact , it 's almost I dare you politics .Each of {them} [855] dares the other one to spend less time , money , and energy than {they} [855] are at {their} [855] own peril .Elderly voters once again in {Florida} [851]{Florida , the most important voting bloc} [856] because {they} [856] actually vote more than any other group .In {this election} [857] , 45 % of {those going to the voting booth} [858]{the voting booth} [859] are expected to be over the age of 65 .The issue most important to {them} [858] , {Social Security} [860] .Pay down {the nation} [813] 's debt , strengthen {Social Security} [860] , cut taxes for middle class family , save our environment .Experience .Vision .Values .Al {Gore} [854] .Why does {Al Gore} [854] say one thing when the truth is another ?{His} [854] attacks on {George Bush} [811]{George Bush 's} [811] {Social Security} [860] plan , exaggerations .The truth , nonpartisan analysis confirms {George Bush} [811]{George Bush 's} [811] plan sets aside $ 2.4 trillion to strengthen {Social Security} [860] .Both {candidates} [861] repeatedly talking about that one issue , but in {Florida} [851] where there are more than 550 children born every day , families drive the other campaign issues .Polls show education , the environment , and the candidate 's character will influence who voters choose .And in this diverse state with a 15 % Hispanic population , {both candidates} [861] courting {their} [861] votes in ways not seen in any previous election .Following {both conventions , Gore and Bush} [862]{Gore} [854] and {Bush} [811] granted {their} [862] first live TV interviews to this man .His name , Jorge Ramos , the Tom Brokaw of Spanish language news .The {race} [863] gets really , really close , and let {'s} [863] suppose that states like {Florida} [851] and Illinois might decide {the election} [857] .maybe , maybe Hispanic votes might decide , too , who would be the next President of {the United States} [852] .The largest Hispanic voting bloc of {Florida} [851] , Republican voters who do not seem to be crossing the party line .Gore wanted the young Cuban boy , Elian Gonzalez to stay in this country .Joe {Lieberman} [864] brings {Gore} [854] support {he} [864] probably would have gotten here anyway .Sizable Jewish and African - American voting blocs .Of {the 10 largest states} [852] , {Florida} [851] is the most Republican .The Republican governor here , {Jeb Bush} [811] was once expected to deliver {his} [811] brother this state .The managers of both campaigns saying in the end , the wipper may simply be determined by who gets more people to {the voting booth} [859] .Kerry {Sanders} [850] , {NBC News} [849] , Anaheim .There was , of course , a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over the weekend of {this trial} [844] going on in the courtroom in {Florida} [851] , and , of course , among the teams of lawyers on the {Bush} [811] side , one of the leaders , Ben Ginsberg , one of the lawyers who argued the case in Leon County Circuit Court .He 's with {us} [865] tonight , victorious in {Tallahassee} [866] , {Florida} [851] , and Ben , whatever the outcome today , and you were on the upside , you are forced now to go along with {the appeals process} [867] as is the right of {the Gore team} [868]{Gore} [854] team .What is your reaction to the work that will cause ?Well , I mean , {we} [865] 're certainly prepared to brief all the issues .I think that {the circuit court judge} [869] , Judge Sauls gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of {Florida} [851] law .Well , let 's talk about your statement earlier today that {the Vice President} [811] -- I guess you were asked should {the Vice President} [811] concede , and you answered , {the Vice President} [811] should do what 's best for {the United States} [852] .Is that what you 're trying to say ?Well , sure .I mean , I think that {all the people involved in this unique situation , the first time a presidential election in our history has been contested , Brian} [870]{Brian} [871] , need to do {the right thing} [872] , and I 'm sure do {the right thing} [872] , as {they} [870] see fit .Do you think {the judge there} [869] , in addition to just giving out {his} [869] ruling at the end of the court session today , {he} [869] went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why {he} [869] turned down {the Gore case} [873]{Gore} [854] case .Do you think {his} [869] method there was to try to make this more or less appeal proof ?Well , I think what {he} [869] did was addressed the situation as it exists in {Florida} [851] and addressed the contingencies that were raised in the voluminous briefs that {he} [869] had , not only from the two party candidates involved , but also of the interveners who were in {the case} [873] .As you know , the Democratic line throughout is they wo n't be happy until every vote is counted , and {we} [874] could n't help but notice , should {we} [874] call it a rhetorical device you used when talking to reporters this afternoon .Pause and listen along with {us} [874] to the following piece of videotape .Those ballots have been counted not once on election night but twice in the recount and how many did you say there were ?10,750 --If you know the exact number , does n't that mean {they} [875] 've been counted ?So I do n't suppose that was any accident on your part ?Well , {they} [875] have been making this point throughout these proceedings that {these ballots} [876] have never been counted , and that is factually not true .They have been counted on election night -- {they} [876] 've been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not the case that {those ballots} [876] have failed to be counted by anyone .Ben , for better or worse , you are forced now to follow {the Gore team} [868]{Gore} [854] team as {they} [876] take you on a kind of trail of appeal here .If you were asked to predict whether this stops at the {Florida} [851] or U.S. Supreme Court , what would your prediction be ?I think it 's one of those situations where I would have predicted all , {Brian} [871] .I think that the decisions are not ours to make .We 'll be involved in all the legal processes obviously as long as {the Gore campaign} [877]{Gore} [854] campaign keeps {them} [877] up , no matter how long that takes .Ben Ginsberg , attorney for the {Bush} [811] team , victorious today in {Tallahassee} [866] .Thank you very much , after a long day , for being with us tonight .Thanks , {Brian} [871] .In the waters off the coast of {Yemen} [878] , two urgent missions tonight collecting evidence from {the suicide bombing} [879] and retrieving bodies still buried in debris .316 were aboard the {`` USS Cole ''} [880] when the terrorists struck .Dozens were injured .17 were killed .Our coverage begins with {NBC} [881]{NBC 's Joe Johns} [882] .A plane carrying the bodies of five dead American sailors from {the `` USS Cole ''} [883] arrived today at Dover Air Force Base , as the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the Department of Defense and {the FBI} [884] arrived in {Yemen} [878] .Their mission -- to continue the search for evidence and suspects in {the explosion} [879] .Also on the way , equipment to lift {the `` Cole ''} [883] out of the water and specialists to help retrieve the bodies of those trapped and presumed dead .We know there are {spaces that are inaccessible} [885] .We know there are some remains in {those spaces} [885] .We need to get in those and locate the remains that we anticipate finding there .Though the work was only beginning , a top {Justice Department} [886] official in {Washington} [887] predicted the outcome of {the investigation} [888] .I 'm confident that we will be able to determine who was behind {the bombing} [879] and that {those people , those organizations} [889] , will be held accountable , {they} [889] will be punished .This critical phase of {the investigation} [888] must be conducted both above and beneath the water on a tight time line .They 'll want to get in there quickly because one of {the problems when you 're dealing with seawater} [890] is {that} [891] {it} [890] will have an adverse effect on your evidence .To further speed up {the process} [867] , {the FBI} [884] has now activated the Strategic Information and Operation Center in {Washington} [887] , conceived after the bombings of the {U.S.} [892] embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers .On the diplomatic front , {the U.S.} [892] said {the government of Yemen} [893]{Yemen} [878] is cooperating with {the investigation} [888] , though {that country} [878] 's President disputes charges that {his nation} [878]{his} [891] nation is a haven for terrorists .The {Justice Department} [886] says no group or individual has been ruled out as a suspect , though many expect that whoever gets the blame will eventually be tied to the terrorist Osama bin Laden .And the grieving continued today at the Naval Academy 's football game against Notre Dame .A moment of silence to remember the victims of this terrorist act .Joe {Johns} [882]{Johns , NBC News .The} [894]{NBC News} [849] .The {`` USS Cole ''} [880] is on {its} [894] long journey home tonight , sitting atop a rescue ship , and now , for the first time , {its} [894] open wound fully visible {.NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski} [895] tonight at the Pentagon with an exclusive report on the damage done and the difficulty in finding those responsible .Jim ?What 's the latest there ?New pictures reveal the sheer power of that terrorist bomb that ripped through the `` USS Cole . ''For the first time , with the `` {Cole} [896] '' out of {the water} [897] , the full impact of {the catastrophic blast} [898] clearly visible .In these photos obtained by {NBC News} [849] , the damage much larger than first imagined , extending well below the water line .Workers on deck dwarfed by the 40 x 60 - foot gaping wound .Large sections of the hull buckled inward .Crewman Sean Powell , back home in {Florida} [851] , says inside {the `` Cole} [899] , '' {it} [900] was chaos , {it} [900] got dark , we lost power , {ship} [899] started to list , that 's what scared everybody .Despite the devastating damage , Navy officials predict {the `` Cole ''} [883]{Cole} [896] '' can be repaired for about $ 150 million , and put back into service .Justice Department officials say in {Yemen} [878] , {the FBI} [884]{the FBI 's investigation} [888] is dead in {the water} [897] .Senior {U.S.} [892] officials tell {NBC News} [849] {the Yemen government} [893] has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind {the `` Cole '' attack} [901]{Cole} [896] '' attack .Evidence is either withheld or tampered with .A {surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the attack} [902]{the attack} [901] was so heavily edited , {it} [902] did n't even show {the blast itself} [898] .Why ?{Yemen} [878] is a terrorist hotbed , and some members of President Saleh 's own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists .It 's hard to see exactly why it is that {the President there} [811] would ever want to cooperate with {the United States} [852] and possibly put {himself} [811] in jeopardy .Reporter :And even though cooperation from {Yemen} [878] is at a standstill , {U.S.} [892]{U.S. officials} [903] tell {NBC News} [849] that {they} [903] are making substantial progress in {the investigation} [888] and are fully confident {they} [903] will get enough evidence to retaliate against those responsible .Tom ?Thanks very much , {NBC} [881]{NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski} [895]{Jim Miklaszewski} [895] tonight .The nation 's highest court will take up {the case} [904] next week .That development may not be as significant as it seems .Joining me now is law professor Rick Pildes , a consultant to {NBC News} [849] .Could a decision from {the U.S. Supreme Court} [905] settle {this case} [904] once and for all ?At this stage , any decision from {the U.S. Supreme Court} [905] is almost certainly not going to provide a final resolution of {this election dispute} [906] .Indeed , the issue is so narrow now before {the Supreme Court} [905] that whichever way {the court} [905] rules , {it} [905] will likely have only the most marginal impact on what 's going on in {Florida} [851] .Even if {the Bush campaign} [877]{Bush} [811] campaign prevails before {the Supreme Court} [905] , {it} [877] simply means we will move more quickly into the contest phase of {the litigation} [907] or the next stage of {the litigation} [907] .But you believe the fact that {the U.S. Supreme Court} [905] just decided to hear {this case} [904] is a partial victory for both {Bush} [811] and {Gore} [854] .It is a partial victory for both sides .For the last two weeks , the central constitutional argument {the Bush campaign} [877]{Bush} [811] campaign has been making to the federal courts is , stop these manual recounts now , {they} [877] violate the Constitution .The {U.S. Supreme Court} [905] refused to hear that part of {the case} [904] , agreeing with all the other federal judges who have unanimously held that this is not the proper time for federal court intervention .So in that sense , a victory for {the Gore campaign} [877]{Gore} [854] campaign .For the {Bush} [811] campaign , a victory in the willingness of {the Supreme Court} [905] to play some role in overseeing the {Florida} [851] system and the {Florida} [851] judicial decision making process .Whatever {the Supreme Court} [905] decides this time , you say {this case} [904] could come back before {the U.S. Supreme Court} [905] again ?John , if {the Supreme Court} [905]{the Supreme Court of the United States} [905]{the United States} [852] is to play a final and decisive role in {this dispute} [906] , that role is going to come at the end of the {Florida} [851] judicial process , not at this stage .Law professor Rick Pildes , thank you .From {BBC News} [849]{BBC News in London} [908]{London} [909] , I am James Cawling for {The World} [910]{The World .The Yugoslav Army} [911] has given {its} [911] support to {President - elect Vojislav Kostunica} [912] .Earlier {he} [912] had an hour long meeting with {former President Slobodan Milosevic} [913] .It 's the first meeting since {Milosevic} [913] was ousted by a popular revolt .He conceded defeat and congratulated {his} [913] successor .Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says , the lifting of international sanctions against {Serbia} [914] can now be discussed .Our {sanctions regime} [915] is not against the people of {Serbia} [914] , {it} [915] was against {Milosevic} [913] , and if {Milosevic} [913] is gone then there are many ways that {the sanctions regime} [915] can be changed and lifted and adjusted .Albright says {Milosevic} [913] must not be allowed to maintain any position of power .Earlier {Russia} [916] also recognized {Kostunica} [912] as {Yugoslavia} [917] 's new leader .Visiting {Foreign Minister Evan Holf} [918] told {Milosevic} [913] {his} [918] time is up .This is {The World} [910] .I am Tony Kahn .Novelist and playwright {Gao Xingjian} [919] today became the first Chinese language author to win the Nobel Prize for Literature .Gao {Xingjian} [919] 's avant - garde plays made {him} [919] persona non-grata in {his} [919] native {China} [920] and {he} [919] fled {the country} [916] in 1988 .He settled in {France} [921] becoming a {French} [922] citizen two years ago .Gregory {Lee} [923] is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at {the University of Lyons} [924]{Lyons} [925] in {France} [921] .Professor {Lee} [923] , I gather you know {the man} [926] and know {his} [926] work .Tell us a little bit about him , Who is {he} [926] and why did {he} [926] flee {China} [920] .Gao {Xingjian} [919] is quite an interesting writer because in some senses {he} [919] differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in {the West} [927] today .I would say that the great difference about {Gao Xingjian} [919] is that {he} [919] actually received a university education .He was educated in {French} [922] , so has a very good knowledge of {French} [922] literature and it is very much {French} [922] literature that has influenced {his} [919] own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse {him} [919] of blind worship of Western models .Sartre is a big man in {Mr. Xingjian} [919] 's life , is n't {he} [919] ?I would say so that Sartre has been a quite a big influence .I think the other influences would be Samuel Beckett , the Irish and French language writer , Unesco .These are models and , of course , all of these writers are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century .Well , this is very interesting because {Mr. Gao} [919] left {China} [920] before Tianenmen .He wrote a play , in particular about the events there .Would you say that {his} [919]{his influences} [928] may be more French literary then {they} [928] were {his} [919] own immediate life experience ?I would say {both} [928] , in fact , because the first play that {he} [919] wrote that made {him} [919] famous was a play that dates from 1981 , which was actually called ` Bus Stop ' , which many people said or had resonances from {Beckett} [929] 's play ` Waiting for Godot ' and it concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came .So , we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of {Beckett} [929] , but {Gao Xingjian} [919] really before 1989 felt , that {he} [919] was unable to write and to have {his} [919] plays produced , as {he} [919] would wish , and so left {China} [920] couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989 .I think {it} [930] is a great day for modern Chinese literature and {it} [930] is a day that has been awaited for the past 60 to 70 years .Gregory {Lee} [923] is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at {the University of Lyons} [924]{Lyons} [925] , {France} [921]{France .He} [931] spoke to {us} [932] from {his} [931] home in Provence .Professor , thank you very much for speaking with {us} [932] .Not at all .Thank you very much .This is {the World} [910] , I am Lisa Mullins .There are mounting allegations of police and military brutality in {Zimbabwe} [933] .But {President Robert Mugabe} [934] has deployed troops to quell rioting over the rising price of food .There are sharp increases here just as {Zimbabwe} [933] has slumped into {its} [933] worst economic crisis since becoming independent in 1980 .In {three days of unrest Army helicopters} [935] have dropped teargas in poor suburbs of the capital {Harare} [936] , but many of those protesting say {they} [935] wo n't stop until Mugabe , the man {they} [935] blame for {the country} [916] 's economic problems , surrenders the presidency .From {Harare} [936] the BBC 's Grant Ferrett reports .Protestors in one of {Harare} [936] 's poor southern townships run for cover as riot police fire teargas from the top of an armored vehicle .Such confrontations have been taking place all over the south of the capital for several days .The aim is twofold , to demand a halt to the rising prices of basics such as food , fuel and transport , as well as the resignation of President Mugabe .People are demonstrating for the price increase fuel and everything .They are trying to stay away .They do n't want to go to work .They want to stay away .So what happened here , can you tell me ?{We} [937] set {a barricade} [938] , not for {our} [937]{our people} [939] but for {the police} [940] .We do n't want {them} [939] .We want {them} [939] to go .And what have {the police} [940] done ?{They} [940] are rounding up people to clear {our barricade} [938] , forcing {them} [938] , beating {them} [938] , throwing teargas canisters into school children , but the war here has just started .Nearly four months after {Zimbabwe} [933] 's bloodiest parliamentary elections , {the economy} [941] has gone from bad to worse .President {Mugabe} [934] 's vitriolic attacks on {the west} [927] combined with continuing lawlessness , particularly on white owned commercial farms have driven away donors , investors and tourists .Zimbabwe now has Africa 's fastest shrinking economy .Many of us like to characterize {Zimbabwe} [933] 's crisis as an economic crisis but it is wider and deeper than economy .Simba {Makoni} [942] looks and sounds like an opposition politician .In fact , {he} [942] is the recently appointed finance minister .You can see the price of bread go up , you can see your bus fares go up , you can see companies closing down or working short weeks and that sort of thing , but you can also read {Zimbabwe} [933] 's crisis in the number of destitute people on the streets , in the number of crimes being committed .245 !245 !{Zimbabwe} [933] earns the bulk of {its} [933] hard currency here on the tobacco auction floors .This year 's crop is down because of the continuing occupation of white owned farms .When the selling season ends next month , {foreign exchange reserves} [943] , hardly estimated to cover just a few days of imports , are likely to completely dry up .Without {them} [943] , paying for central imports such as fuel and electricity will become even more difficult .What we have right now is {a political crisis} [944] and until {that political crisis} [944] is resolved , there is no way {the economy} [941] is going to improve .The sentiments of economist Howard Setoli are widely shared .With eighteen months to go until scheduled presidential elections , {Zimbabwe} [933] is headed for complete economic ruin .If {government} [945] continues on {its} [945] current path , {the economy} [941] will continue to contract .This year {it} [941] was expected to contract by 8 % .Next year we see a further contraction of 12 % .So we are talking of massive unemployment , severe foreign exchange shortage .It is an alarming prediction .For those taking part in the protests on the streets , after two decades in office they want {President Mugabe} [934] to go now .We want a new President .The situation is like {Yugoslavia} [917] now .We do n't want {Mugabe} [934] .No more .For {The World} [910] , I am Grant Ferrett , in {Harare} [936] .From {BBC News} [849]{BBC News in London} [908]{London} [909] , I 'm James Cawling , for {The World} [910] .Clashes between Israeli Army units and {Palestinians} [946] have continued into the night .That 's after another day of violence in which four {Palestinians} [946] were killed .Helicopter gunships were deployed around the West Bank village of Bagella .Exchanges of fire between Israelis and {Palestinians} [946] have also been reported around Jericho , {Greg Barrow} [947] reports .A day of violence across the West Bank and Gaza has been followed by more clashes after nightfall .Houses in the West Bank village of {Bagella} [948] have been attached by {Israeli helicopter gunships} [949] .An Israeli military spokesman said {they} [949] were deployed in response to gun fire from {Palestinians} [946] inside Bagella , which was aimed at the Jewish settlement of Kilo .The Israelis say the helicopters went into action firing machine guns , but unconfirmed reports from inside {Bagella} [948] suggested rockets may have been used .Greg {Barrow} [947] , {BBC News} [849] , Jerusalem .This is {the World} [910] I am Lisa Mullins .Well {we} [950] ca n't tell you who won Florida , but in a moment {we} [950] will enter the musical question , who let the dogs out ?First up {we} [950] have the answer to {our} [950] geo quiz today .We are looking for a region of central {Italy} [951] bordering the Adriatic Sea .The area is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno , the highest peak of the Apennines .It also includes a lot of sheep , good clean - living , {healthy sheep , and an Italian entrepreneur} [952] has an idea about how to make a little money of {them} [952] .The answer is {Abruzzo} [953] .Journalist {Carlos Depalazai} [954] was in {Rome} [955] , {Italy} [951] and {Carlo} [956] how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of {the Abruzzo} [953]{Abruzzo} [953] ?{He} [954] is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in the Italy at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food .So {this guy} [954] came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet .So you can have access through your computer on your desk .Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted .So what does it mean to adopt {a sheep} [957] , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of {its} [957] progress on the farm in {Italy} [951] ?You are not actually adopting {the sheep} [957] in the sense that you can have {it} [957] with you .It looks like distant adoption , where you do n't actually have the child in your home .You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .It works in the same way , so you have access on the web site of this little farm , in a little village of Abrutzi and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of money {the sheep} [957] is actually yours .All right , so the amount of money you have mentioned to {us} [958] is about 160 US dollars and for that you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling .You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of {the sheep} [957] and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door .Yeah , I mean {this} [959] is quite funny , but apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange I think what is really important is that {it} [959] is a sign of a new concern that is effecting Italian people .I mean {we} [958] are notoriously lover of good food .We have a generous attitude towards food , and this is a new stuff .The fact that you really care about a sheep in the way {she} [960] is fed , in the way {she} [960] is nurtured , in the way people are looking after it , because it 's a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on {your table} [961] up {the end} [962] .Wait a minute , you said that on {your table} [961]{your table at the end} [963]{the end} [962] .Yeah , at {the table} [963] {if} [964] {it} [964] becomes food for instance , which is an option .You are adopting {the sheep} [957] and whatever happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing .I mean usually when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving {an animal} [965] not eventually eating {it} [965] .I mean {this} [966] is an option which is available and I think {it} [966] is a sort of provocation .You know Italians now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like {Rome} [955] , Florence , Naples .In the past , {we} [967] were a population of shepherds or farmers .We had completely different attitude towards nature .It seems that {we} [967] are losing something , and {we} [967] need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that {the Environment Minister in Italy} [968]{Italy} [951] supported the initiative and {he} [968]{he himself} [968] adopted a sheep is significant .He took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of Italians towards nature and farms .Carlo De Blazia , journalist speaking to us from {Rome} [955] .Thank you very much {Carlo} [956] .Nice to talk to you .Thank you .Five years ago today , the agreement ending {the war in Bosnia} [969]{Bosnia} [970] was initialed in {Dayton} [971]{Dayton Ohio .Western leaders} [972] were n't wild about relying on {Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic} [973] to help implement the accord , but {they} [972] felt {they} [972] had no choice .Five years later , the West and {the United States} [974] in particular are n't counting on {the deposed leader} [973] for anything .They want to see {his} [973] successor Vojislav Kostinica extradite {Milosevic} [973] through {the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague} [975]{The Hague} [976] , but not only is {Milosevic} [973] still living comfortable in {Belgrade} [977] , last night {he} [973] made {his} [973] first TV appearance in six weeks , giving a pep talk to {his} [973] supporters .The {World} [910] 's {Jeb Sharp} [978] reports on the still unresolved fate of {Slobodan Milosevic} [973] .He 's kept Western diplomats spinning in circles for more than a decade .Five years ago {they} [979] were negotiating with {Milosevic} [973] at {Dayton} [971] to stop {the war in Bosnia} [969]{Bosnia} [970] .Two years ago {they} [979] were still shuttling back and forth to {Belgrade} [977] in an effort to solve the Kosovo crisis .By March of last year {they} [979] had given up talking and {Nato} [980] had started bombing instead .When {Milosevic} [973] was indited on war crimes charges soon after , US and other Western officials began calling for {his} [973] arrest and transfer to {The Hague} [976] , but now that a delicate transition is underway in {Serbia} [981] , those calls have grown quieter , according to Gary Bass , the author of the new book about war crimes trials , ` Stay , the Hand of Vengeance ' .Even Madeleine Albright , who is with the President who is usually most decipherous about the importance of prosecuting war criminals , has in fact said that our first priority is making sure that {Vojislov Kostunica} [982] can consolidate {his} [982]{his democratic government} [983] and make that transition , and the issue of punishing war criminals sort of takes a back seat .Bass says US diplomats do n't want to risk destabilizing {Serbia} [981] 's fragile political situation by pushing too hard for war crimes trials .After all Bass points out , outside pressure has backfired in the past .In Germany after {World War I} [984] and in the Ottoman Empire also after {World War I} [984] , the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials , and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash .A nationalist backlash in {Serbia} [981] right now could play into {Milosevic} [973] 's hands , especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for next month .That 's one reason Western governments are not demanding {his} [973] immediate arrest , but critics of this approach say letting {Milosevic} [973] stay in {Belgrade} [977] could be equally destabilizing .Eva Barnetts , professor of history at Yale , says {President Kostunica} [982] should cooperate immediately with {the Hague Tribunal} [975] .This {particular UN institution} [985] has in {its} [985] power really to give instant legitimacy to {Kostunica} [982] but of course at a price .It means that {the government of Yugoslavia} [983]{Yugoslavia} [986] has to become very serious about dealing with the indited war criminals , beginning with {Slobodan Milosevic} [973]{Slobodan Milosevic himself} [973] .But {even officials at The Hague} [987]{The Hague} [976] say {they} [987] are willing to be patient with {the new Yugoslav President .Tribunal spokesman Jim Landel} [988] says {it} [988] helps that {Kostunica} [982] 's people who initially refused to even entertain the idea of arresting {Milosevic} [973] , may be starting to cooperate with {the Tribunal} [975] .They have already indicated that {they} [987] are willing to allow the reopening of {the prosecutor} [989] 's liaison office in {Belgrade} [977] , and that 's certainly a welcome first step .However , it is only a first step .The {Tribunal 's chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte} [990] has applied for a Yugoslav visa and plans to visit {Belgrade} [977] soon .Delponte 's spokeswoman says {the prosecutor} [989] has much to discuss with {Kostunica} [982] , not least how to arrest all the indited war crimes suspects now in {Serbia} [981] .That wo n't be easy .Even in {Bosnia} [970] where {Nato} [980] is in charge , troops have failed to capture {Bosnian - Serb leader Radavan Karadzic} [991] , indited on genocide charges in connection with the 1995 massacre at Shrabanitca .Yale history professor Eva Barnett says the excuses for not arresting {Karadzic} [991] are not persuasive .The claim is that this would engender tremendously destabilizing consequences that in any event it might be a very , very bloody affair and so on .This does not seem terribly compelling to me .I think that it has to be tried and of course there is always a danger that somebody might get hurt in this , but that is a danger that every attempt at remedying criminal activity has to face .Hague {prosecutor Carla Del Ponte} [990] is prepared to discuss arrest strategies with {Kostunica} [982] including the use of foreign troops .It 's difficult to know how {he} [982] would react {.Kostunica} [982] has questioned the legality of {the Hague Tribunal} [975] , and talked of trying {Milosevic} [973] in {Yugoslavia} [986] .Still , {Kostunica} [982] 's grace period wo n't last forever .When {the US Congress} [992] approved one hundred million dollars in {aid to Serbia} [993]{Serbia} [981] last month , {it} [992] stipulated {the aid} [993] would stop flowing if {Belgrade} [977] has n't cooperated with {the tribunal} [975] by March 31st .For {The World} [910] , I am {Jeb Sharp} [978] .This is {The World} [910] .I am Lisa Mullins .Both {George W. Bush} [994]{George W. Bush and Al Gore} [995]{Al Gore} [996] today continue to press {their} [995] cases literally and figuratively .Their PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly .Governor {Bush} [994] 's running mate Dick Cheney talked with reporters about the Republican transition plans , another signal that {Bush} [994] is getting ready to become the next President of {the United States} [974] .Meanwhile , {Vice President Gore} [996] continued {his} [996] appeal for patience while {he} [996] contests {Bush} [994] 's claim to victory , and attorneys for both men were preparing for key court battles later in the week , which could settle the three - week dispute over who won {Florida} [997] and the presidency .The {World} [910]{World 's Clark Boyd} [998] has the latest .All eyes were on {Florida} [997] yet again today as lawyers , judges , lawmakers and citizens , all picked at the knots that have tied up the conclusion of {this presidential election} [999] for the past three weeks .Yesterday in {Leon County Circuit Court} [1000] , {Judge N. Sander Sauls} [1001] set a Saturday deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and {Palm Beach} [1002] counties , not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth , to be brought to Tallahassee under police escort .Today , as officials in both two counties ready the ballots for transport , {George W. Bush} [994]{George W. Bush 's} [994] lawyers asked {the judge} [1001] to order all 1.16 million ballots from the two counties to be trucked to the state capital .Late this afternoon , {Judge Sauls} [1001]{Sauls} [1001] granted that motion .In {Washington} [1003] , {Vice President Al Gore} [996] was back on television this morning trying to shore up public support for {his} [996] legal cause .In a taped interview , for NBC 's Today Show , {Gore} [996] said despite all the legal maneuvering {he} [996] is calling on both camps to put partisan politics aside .I think that both {Governor Bush and I} [1004] should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of our partisan supporters .Meanwhile , {Bush} [994] 's vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy man today .After a heart checkup at a {Washington} [1003] hospital {he} [996] appeared at a news conference to say that {he} [996] is pressing ahead with transition plans .We have now acquired office space in McClain , Virginia that will become the site for the transition operation that {we} [1005] announced two days ago , so {we} [1005] are just in a business of getting up and running , but {we} [1005] now have an office with a lot of space .We have got people signing up , volunteers coming on , telephones being put in and computers , so {we} [1005] will be fully operational within the next day or two .Earlier today in {Florida} [997] , the Republican dominated legislature began hearings on calling a special session to pick {the state} [997] 's electors itself , should the December 12th deadline still find {the election} [999] tied up in the courts .The committee heard from angry voters and precinct workers in {Palm Beach} [1002] .I believe our issues do relate directly to the appointing of electors for the state of {Florida} [997] .The electors need to be appointed , are supposed to be appointed according to {the will of the people} [1006]{the people} [1007] and I believe in Palm Beach County that it was very difficult to determine what {the will of the people} [1006]{the people} [1007] was .Although {Al Gore} [996] said today that {he} [996] certainly feels like {he} [996] won {the election} [999] , {he} [996] put {his} [996] odds of wining the various legal battles at fifty - fifty .Gore said , if {Bush} [994] does triumph in court , {he} [994] will throw {his} [994] support behind the Republican President - elect .But for now , says {former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche} [1009]{Clinton} [1008] administration cabinet member Robert Riche , {both sides} [1010] are positive that {they} [1010] 've won {the election} [999] , and says {Riche} [1009] , {the} [1011] longer the fight goes on , {the} [1011] more troublesome the next four years might be .What we risk by prolonging this is greater public cynicism and a hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to work together .After all , come January , these people are going to have to be in {Washington} [1003] whether {Gore} [996]{Gore or Bush} [1004]{Bush} [994] is {the President} [996] .You have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work together with {the new President} [994] and with each other , so we do n't want to prolong this forever .The {US Supreme Court} [1000] will hear arguments from {both sides} [1010] on Friday and {Florida} [997] 's {Leon County Circuit Court} [1000] will consider the arguments on disputed state ballots on Saturday , and while the nation wearies of the protracted legal battle maybe {Leon County Circuit Court} [1000] judge {N. Sander Sauls} [1001] said it best .The whole process , {he} [1001] said , is a bit like being nibbled to death by a duck .For {The World} [910] , this is {Clark Boyd} [998] .Russia 's lower house of {parliament} [1012] has overwhelmingly approved restoring {the former Soviet anthem} [1013] as {the Russian national anthem} [1013]{Russian} [1014] national anthem .The move had the strong support of {Russian} [1014] President Vladimir Putin who said use of {the old anthem} [1013] represented a gesture of reconciliation .Critics argued that {the anthem} [1013] is a throwback to the former totalitarian government .The {anthem} [1013] will have new words , eliminating verses that praised Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin .The lower house of {parliament} [1012] also gave formal endorsement to Russia 's white , red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military .From BBC news in London , I am Gregor Cragey for {The World} [910]{The World .George W. Bush} [910]{.George W. Bush} [994] has met with {Al Gore} [996] in {Washington} [1003] .The {two men} [1015] met for just 15 minutes at the Vice President 's official residence .It 's the first time {they} [1015] 've been face to face since the bitterly contested presidential election was finally concluded last week .Bush went into the talks with his defeated rival after meeting with {President Clinton} [1008] earlier today .At a photo opportunity in the Oval Office , {Bush} [994] thanked {the President} [982] and fended off an interruption from a veteran White House correspondent .I am humbled and honored , and I ca n't thank {the President} [994] enough for {his} [994] hospitality .He did n't need to do this .Yes , {he} [994] did .I have n't quite finished yet .And I am grateful and I am going to look forward to the discussion .I am here to listen .For {his} [994] part {President Clinton} [1008] said {his} [1008] only advice to {Bush} [994] is to assemble a good team and to do what {he} [994] thinks is right .Bush is now heading back to {Texas} [1016] .The {Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak} [1017] is due to meet with Egypt 's President Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday .The encounter is being seen as an effort by {Barak} [1017] to drum up regional support for a Middle East peace agreement based on {President Clinton} [1008] 's proposals .They require {Israel} [1018] to relinquish sovereignty over most of Arab East Jerusalem and {the Palestinians} [1019] to scale back {their} [1019] demand for a return of refugees , but Palestinian chief negotiator Sayeb Erekat says more details are required before {both sides} [1010] can strike a deal .We have so many questions that {we} [1020] have ... so many points that need to be clarified .The most important thing is the clarity .The most important thing is that {we} [1020] focus on the travails of the peace process {.Israeli settlers} [1021] are worried that most of the settlements in {the West Bank} [1022] will be dismantled if an agreement is reached .The spokeswoman for {this Settlers '} [1021] Council Yahudi Tayar says this is unacceptable .We have a situation where instead of protecting the interests of the Jewish people , {the Israeli Prime Minister} [1017] is willing to forgo on all of the vital and important areas and not only our history , but the security of the future for the Jewish people in {Israel} [1018] .More than 300 people have been killed in the West Bank and {Gaza Strip} [1023] since {September .The head of the Palestinian Television and Radio} [1024] has been shot dead in {the Gaza Strip} [1023] .Masked gunmen opened fire on Hisham Mekki at a hotel in Gaza City but the motive for the attack is unclear .You 're listening to {BBC News} [1025] .A Venezuelan Ford executive says {Firestone} [1026] hid information about tyre defects from {Ford} [1027] and should be held responsible for {more than one hundred traffic accidents in the South American country} [1028] .Hector Rodriguez told the hearing of the Venezuelan Consumer Protection Agency that {Bridgeton Firestone} [1026] knew about the tyre defects for many months and should be held responsible for {the accidents} [1028] .In a letter to {the consumer panel} [1029] a spokesman for {Firestone} [1026] said {the company} [1026] 's appearance at Wednesday 's hearing would have implied fault , which {it} [1026] denies .The {Venezuelan government panel} [1029]{Venezuelan} [1030] government panel wants both {Ford} [1027] and {Firestone} [1026] to compensate victims of accidents caused by {Ford} [1027] vehicles equipped with {Firestone} [1026] tyres .Some 46 people have died on {Venezuelan} [1030] highways in accidents caused by the vehicles .North {Korean leader Kim Jong Il} [1031] has sent {his} [1031] second - in - command to {the United States} [974] for talks that could see new steps towards ending the Cold War animosity between the two nations .Vice - marshall Jo Myong Rok is to meet President Clinton and

sanctions {it} [1032] imposed on {Yugoslavia} [1033] two years ago .As {VOA} [1034]{VOA 's Eve Cornet} [1035] reports from {Belgrade} [1036] , {a US special envoy} [1037] gave {the news} [1025] to {President Vojislav Kostunica} [994] .Balkans advisor James O'Brien and {President Kostunica} [994] met for the first top - level talks between {the United States} [974] and {Yugoslavia} [1033] , since the break of diplomatic relations on the eve of Nato air strikes in 1999 .President {Kostunica} [994] said {he} [994] was ready for dialogue with the West , but stressed that territorial accords reached with international negotiators in {the Balkans} [1038] should be respected .Balkans {envoy O'Brian} [1037] stressed that the US would begin lifting sanctions against {Yugoslavia} [1033] and that only technical issues remain an obstacle to reestablishing relations .However , key sanctions which directly target ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and {his} [994] allies remain in place .Meanwhile , {parties in Slobodan Milosevic 's socialist coalition} [1039]{Slobodan Milosevic 's} [1040] socialist coalition are making it clear {they} [1039] plan to hold onto control of the Serbian government , despite calls for new elections .Eve {Cornet} [1035] , {VOA News} [1025] , {Belgrade} [1036] .A leading expert on international finance , Johns Hopkins University economist , {Steve Hanky} [1041] says {Yugoslavia} [1033]{Yugoslavia 's new President Vojislav Kostunica} [1042] only has a few weeks to reassure financial stability in {the dominant republic of Serbia} [1043]{Serbia} [1044] by stabilizing the inflation - prone Yugoslav dinar .VOA 's Barry Wood spoke with Mr. Hanky , who recently returned from several weeks in Europe .Mr. {Hanky} [1041] says that {President Kostunica} [1042] has only two options for achieving financial stability in {Serbia} [1044] .He can either abandon {the dinar} [1045] and adopt the German mark as {the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro} [1043]{Montenegro} [1046] has done or , {Mr. Hanky} [1041] says , {Serbia} [1044] can adopt a currency board system under which a new currency would be issued under conditions of utmost financial discipline .I think if {Kostunica} [994] does not move in a direction decisively within the next month of abandoning {the dinar} [1045] completely or going to a deutsche {mark} [1047] based currency board where we have a foreign governor on the board , the chances for economic unification in the area and economic recovery in {Serbia} [1044] are slim at best .Mr. {Hanky} [1041] says it 's essential that {President Kostunica} [994] embrace the principle of sound money , something {Mr. Hanky} [1041] believes is as important as the rule of law .Last week , {the new acting head of the Yugoslav Central Bank} [1024]{the Yugoslav Central Bank} [1022] devalued {the dinar} [1045] , bringing {it} [1024] to 30 to the dollar , compared to the previous official rate of 20 .Mr. Hanky , who regards {the dinar} [1045] as {the world} [910] 's worst currency , says {the deutsch mark} [1047] is becoming the de facto money in {the entire Balkan region} [1048] .If {they} [1047] use {the d mark} [1047] in {Serbia} [1044] , obviously there would be essentially the same system that {they} [1047] have in {Montenegro} [1046] and if {they} [1047] had a currency board with a foreign national running the thing , like Bosnia , it would essentially mean that {they} [1047] had a unified system was what {they} [1047] have in {Montenegro} [1046] because with {Montenegro} [1046] , {they} [1047] would still have the d mark as legal tender , but {they} [1047] would also use this new currency board money from {Serbia} [1044] and there would be absolutely no problem , and furthermore , from a regional point of view , you 'd have essentially most of {the Balkans} [1038] in a unified currency zone because Bulgaria has a currency board that 's d mark based .Bosnia has a currency board that 's d mark based .Kosovo has a d mark , {Montenegro} [1046] has a d mark .Mr. {Hanky} [1041] was instrumental in developing {the deutsche mark based currency systems throughout the region} [1049]{the region} [1048] .Advisors to {Mr. Kostunica} [994] say {they} [1049] are considering a currency board system for {Serbia} [1044] .Barry Wood , {VOA News} [1025] , {Washington} [1003] .A {Russian}

Bucharest .A special envoy of {Yugoslavia} [1033]{Yugoslavia 's new President Vojislav Kostunica} [1042] reaffirmed {his country} [1033]{his} [1042] country 's commitment to peace in {the region}

[1016] , the Republican nominee , holds a 49 % to 42 % advantage over {his} [1052] Democratic opponent Al Gore , the Vice President , but two other major surveys gave {Mr. Bush} [994] only a one - point lead .On {Sunday} [1053] , {several major newspapers} [1054] weighed in with {their} [1054] endorsements and {VOA} [1034]{VOA 's Peter Hymline} [1055] has that story .In {its} [1055] Sunday editions , {the New York Times} [1056] calls {Vice President Gore} [1057] , {the man} [994] best equipped for {the presidency} [1058] by virtue of {his} [994] knowledge of government , {his} [994] experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision making and {his} [994] devotion to the general welfare .The {Times} [1056]{Times editorial} [1059] says {Mr. Gore} [1057] has , in {its} [1059] words , struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration 's ethical lapses .The paper 's editorial board goes on to say , we believe {Mr. Gore} [1057] would never follow {Bill Clinton 's} [1060] example of reckless conduct that cheapens {the Presidency} [1058] .The {Times} [1056] also praise {Republican candidate George W Bush} [994] for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but {the writers} [1061] said {they} [1061] had concluded {Mr. Bush} [994] 's agenda was harsh on issues such as women 's rights , guns , and law enforcement .The {Times} [1056] joins {the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave its backing to Mr. Gore} [1062]{its} [1056] backing to {Mr. Gore} [1057] .Other major dailies throwing {their} [1062] support to {the Vice President} [1057] {Sunday} [1053] included The Philadelphia Inquirer , The Denver Post and The San Jose California Mercury News .Mr. {Bush} [994] also picked up some key endorsements {Sunday} [1053] including both major Chicago papers .In {its} [1056] editorial , {The Chicago Tribune} [1063] called {Mr. Gore} [1057] a decent man but concluded that , in {its} [1056] words , {his} [994] penchant for enhancement has become something of a running joke .The {Tribune} [1063] endorsement says this is an election about honesty , about restoring bipartisanship , about fostering government that will nurture a booming economy without getting in the way of American ingenuity .The paper concludes that there is one candidate who will do that and that is {George W Bush} [994] .The battle of the editorials reflects what many political analysts predict will be one of the closest Presidential races in decades .Most opinion polls give {Mr. Bush} [994] a slight lead but a just released survey by {Newsweek} [1064] magazine puts the text .The {Newsweek} [1064] poll indicates {voters} [1065] consider {Vice President Gore} [1057] the more intelligent candidate , but {they} [1065] see {Governor Bush} [994] as more honest .Peter {Hymline} [1055] , {VOA News} [1025] , Washington .Meanwhile , in Philadelphia {the Phillies} [1066] have hired {Larry Bowa} [1067] as

D. Ye , the TBAD began working seriously in 1994 to establish a school , but the difficulties were considerable .They had to find land , funds , teachers , and much more .With {Taiwanese} [1151] and mainland authorities at political loggerheads , the school 's promoters had to jump through hoops every step of the way in seeking to hire teachers from {Taiwan} [1139] , use {Taiwanese} [1151] teaching materials , and appoint a {Taiwanese} [1151] person to the post of principal .They also had to obtain the cooperation of the authorities in {Taiwan} [1139] .Since {the people in Dongguan} [1152]{Dongguan} [1144] were paying taxes in {Taiwan} [1139] and planning to run {the school} [1150] according to the Taiwanese system , {they} [1152] asked whether the Ministry of Education might not treat {the school} [1150] the same as any private school in {Taiwan} [1139] , and subsidize {it} [1150] accordingly .Teacher seniority was also a major issue in the effort to get {the school} [1150] established ; if {teachers from public schools} [1153] were to teach in {Dongguan} [1144] , would {they} [1153] retain the seniority that {they} [1153] had built up in {Taiwan} [1139] ?\" If {we} [1154] had n't been able to hire experienced teachers , \" notes {Ye} [1132] , \" it would have seriously impaired the quality of {our} [1154] faculty . \"{Ye} [1132] continually stressed to authorities in both {Taiwan} [1139] and {the mainland} [1129] , \" Politics is for the politicians .In the meantime , {our} [1155] children need an education .That 's all {we} [1155] 're asking . \"The main obstacles were finally overcome by the end of 1999 .The {mainland Chinese authorities} [1156] have agreed to allow the use of Taiwanese teaching materials and faculty .As for the appointment of a principal , TBAD vice chairman Andrew Yeh states , \" I think {the mainland authorities} [1156] will handle the situation flexibly .They 'll probably let {us} [1155] hire who {we} [1155] want as long as {we} [1155] agree to refer to the person as a director or something like that . \"The Dongguan city government has leased an 86,000 - square - meter site to {the association} [1136] at an extremely low price , and {the school} [1150]{the school 's cornerstone} [1157] was laid last year in a ceremony held on 3 November .The school will begin admitting students this coming September and start classes in October .The school will accept elementary and junior high school students at first .The decision about whether to open senior high school classes will be made later depending on demand .Where to send {the kids} [1143] ?{H. D. Ye} [1132] notes that there are now about 400 children of Taiwanese expatriates in {Dongguan} [1144] who attend school in {the mainland} [1129] .Greater than half attend {mainland China} [1129] 's regular elementary and secondary schools , while {the more affluent Taiwanese} [1158] send {their} [1158] children to private schools for expatriate children .Chang Mei - liang , chairperson of {the TBAD Women 's Division} [1140] , is among the latter group .After {her} [1159]{her elder son and daughter} [1160] finished elementary school in {Taiwan} [1139] {she} [1159] sent {them} [1160] to a boarding school in Britain .Her {ten - year - old child} [1161] is too young for that though , so {she} [1159] sends {him} [1161] to a school in {Shenzhen} [1162] for the children of {Hong Kong} [1163] expats .The child only comes home once a week , and sending {him} [1161] to {the school in Shenzhen} [1150]{Shenzhen} [1162] costs several hundred thousand NT dollars per year .The {Hong Kong} [1163]{Hong Kong elementary school and the international school} [1164]{the international school} [1150] are both an hour or two away from {Dongguan} [1144] , and many of the Taiwanese in {Dongguan} [1144] want to be able to see {their} [1164] children every day .This prompted a group of {them} [1164] to establish a private bilingual school called {Little Oxford} [1165] in February 1998 .The school admits children from kindergarten -LRB- age five -RRB- through grade five of elementary school .Some of {Little Oxford} [1165]{Oxford} [1166] 's 200 students -LRB- such as {Norman Hsu 's} [1147] child -RRB- used to go to school in {Shenzhen} [1162] , while others have transferred in from the mainland Chinese public school system .Little {Oxford} [1166] is very similar to {the Taiwanese school} [1150] being promoted by the TBAD .Most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in {Taiwan} [1139] 's elementary schools , and of the 15 or so teachers there , three are from {Taiwan} [1139] .The big difference is that classes are taught in both Chinese and English because {the Taiwanese parents} [1167] are very interested in seeing that {their} [1167] children learn English well .According to Huang Su , executive director of {Little Oxford} [1165] , \" A lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children 's education is exactly like the regular system in {Taiwan} [1139] , but I have to remind {them} [1167] that once you 've left in {Taiwan} [1139] , you 're not regular any longer . \"According to {Huang} [1168] , making {the school} [1150] a mirror image of those in {Taiwan} [1139] does not necessarily mean that you are running a good school .The key is to provide an education that meets the needs of the students .In addition to {Taiwanese} [1169] teaching materials , {she} [1169] has also incorporated some materials from {the mainland} [1129] and overseas into the curriculum .Huang Su , who hails from Beijing , majored in English at university and is keenly interested in education .She came to {Dongguan} [1144] after marrying a {Taiwanese} [1149] expat there , and it was the Taiwanese business community that asked {her} [1169] to run a school .Little {Oxford} [1166] now has a very good reputation in the Taiwanese community .In fact , {some Taiwanese} [1170]{Taiwanese} [1149] send {their} [1170] children to {Little Oxford} [1165] from as far away as Zhuhai -LRB- just opposite Macau on the other side of the Pearl River estuary -RRB- {.Huang} [1171] has been deeply impressed by the deep concern that {Taiwanese parents} [1172] show for {their} [1172] children 's education in the face of difficulties posed by living away from {their} [1172] native {Taiwan} [1139] .One parent , for example , practically begged {her} [1169] to admit {his} [1173] six - year old child , explaining , \" {He} [1173] 's never had any playmates .The only people {he} [1173] 's ever been with are {his} [1173] nanny and some employees from the plant . \"The Taiwanese kids at {Little Oxford} [1165]{Oxford} [1166] come from many different backgrounds .Some speak in a mixture of Chinese and English , while {others} [1174] speak and look just like any mainland Chinese child .Many of {them} [1174] have transferred in and out of lots of different schools in the United States , {Taiwan} [1139] , and {the mainland} [1129] .There is no trace of {the world} [1175] 's cares on {their} [1174] faces though ; the thing {they} [1174] 're most concerned about is studying a little less and playing a little more .One bespectacled child laments , \" School is better in Canada because {they} [1174] do n't have to do so much homework .There 's too much homework in {Taiwan} [1139] and {the mainland} [1129] .It 's no fun . \"{An older brother and sister} [1176] , it turns out , have {both} [1176] lived overseas {.Huang} [1171] stays in close touch with {the Taiwanese parents} [1167] .Their {children} [1177] enjoy very comfortable homes and seem to have experienced much of {the world} [1175] , but the biggest problem is that \" {they} [1177] are n't motivated and do n't understand why {they} [1177] should need to study . \"Another problem for {the school} [1150] is the lack of interesting things to do in {Dongguan} [1144] .Unless {teachers} [1178] are very devoted to education , {they} [1178] are not likely to stay there long .\" It 's all the more difficult , \" notes {Huang} [1168] frankly , \" to hold on to teachers from {Taiwan} [1139] , who ca n't help but compare {their} [1178] situation here with what {they} [1178] are accustomed to in {Taiwan} [1139] . \"{The Taiwanese school} [1150] will be faced with the same high turnover rate that has dogged {Little Oxford} [1165]{Oxford} [1166] .Dongguan , cradle of scholarsWith Little {Oxford} [1166] already in operation , why should {the Taiwanese expats} [1179] wish to establish a separate school for {their} [1179] children ?Sylvia Yang points out that {Little Oxford} [1165] is a private school with limited space and teaching staff , and even without the boarding expenses charged in {Shenzhen} [1162] , the tuition at {Little Oxford} [1165]{Oxford} [1166] still costs RMB 38,000 -LRB- NT$ 160,000 -RRB- per semester , more than many Taiwanese parents can pay .Says {H. D. Ye} [1132] , \" We would like to get funding from both the {Taiwan} [1139] and mainland authorities to hold tuition down . \"Although {the cornerstone} [1157] has already been laid , {Ye} [1132] reports that not enough funds have been raised , nor have all the teachers been hired .Although the picture generally looks pretty good , there is still much work to be done .Expenses for the first few years are expected to reach NT$ 60 million , and only about NT$ 20 million has been raised so far .Ye often speaks in {Taiwan} [1139] on the topic of investing in {the mainland} [1129] , something which he knows a lot about .Says {Ye} [1132] jokingly , \" I jack up my speaking fees to make extra money for {the school} [1150] . \"The TBAD is now considering funding {the school} [1150] through an endowment , shares in which would be sold to business firms .The location for {the school} [1150] has already been selected .It is a large site in the township of {Zhongtang} [1180] .The lot is basically empty right now , but the roar of excavators fills the air , and the steel piles have already been driven .The school grounds are located next to the ancient Beidi Temple , which is shaded by the leaves of a spreading banyan tree .On the temple gate a fading couplet reads : \" {He} [1181] who is truly dedicated to {his} [1181] endeavor will become a great master , and shall make of {his} [1181] surroundings a land of delight .He who has achieved true wisdom shall make of {his} [1181] home a cynosure for great talent , no matter where {he} [1181] may be . \"The locals must have taken {this message} [1182] to heart over the years , because {it} [1182] is said that hometown scholars from {Zhongtang} [1180] often took the top spot in the imperial examinations of centuries past .It is very gratifying that a place like {Dongguan} [1144] , with {its} [1144] abundant business opportunities , should also have a scenic spot so rich in scholarly tradition .It is also exciting to look forward to the founding of a school for the Taiwanese business community .Apart from making money , will the expatriates here create a \" Taiwanese miracle \" on the cultural front as well ?p. 91Little Oxford , a bilingual elementary school attended primarily by the children of Taiwanese expatriates , guards its entranceway closely .A school bus takes students to and from school , and {all visitors} [1183] must announce {themselves} [1183] before entering .p. 92Little {Oxford} [1166] elementary school teaches classes in both Chinese and English , which is just what {the Taiwanese expatriates} [1184] want for {their} [1184] children .p. 93H. {D. Ye} [1132] is a key player in {Dongguan} [1144] 's Taiwanese expatriate community .He has played the lead role in establishing a Taiwanese school in {Dongguan} [1144] .The community 's ability to wrap up preparations and start construction in just two years is due in large part to {Ye} [1132] 's energy and enthusiasm .Taiwan {News Holds Seminar on Cross-Strait RelationsThe biggest story of the year in Taiwan} [1185]{Taiwan} [1139] has naturally been the changing of the guard at the presidential palace as a result of the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- victory in the election on 18 March .Jin Zhong , president and editor - in - chief of {Hong Kong} [1163] 's OPEN magazine , which specializes in political reporting and commentary , spent an entire week in {Taiwan} [1139] observing the election campaign and {its} [1139] aftermath , and on 20 March , OPEN organized a seminar titled \" The New President and Cross-Strait Relations . \"{The seminar} [1185] was held in cooperation with Taiwan News , one of the island 's oldest English - language newspapers -LRB- known until last year as the China News -RRB- .The KMT ticket finished nearly 14 percentage points behind independent candidate James Soong and pulled in fully two million votes fewer than {the DPP ticket} [1186] , a margin of defeat which {Jin Zhong} [1187] described in {his} [1187] opening remarks as stunning .When Chinese Communist premier Zhu Rongji made belligerent remarks a few days before {the election} [1188] in an effort to scare voters away from {the DPP ticket} [1186] , {the ruling party} [1189] made a grievous mistake , opined Jin , when {it} [1189] failed to come out strongly critical of Zhu and attempted instead to capitalize on the incident by playing the \" fear card . \"At the same time , however , winning candidate Chen Shui - bian captured only 39 % of the vote , which translates to a weak mandate .As a result , {he} [1187] must take a moderate line that stresses inter-party cooperation .He will have to include a wide range of people in {his} [1187] government , keep a low profile , guard against any temptation to grow imperious in power , and strive to be a president of all the people .As for {mainland China} [1129] 's saber - rattling , {Jin} [1190] argued that there is no need for undue concern .Stated {Jin} [1190] , \" The consequences would be too severe .It 's not like {Taiwan} [1139] is without any means of retaliation .Are the mainland authorities really prepared to see {Hong Kong} [1163] and {Shanghai} [1191] go up in flames ? \"There are other perspectives on cross-strait relations , of course .The seminar participants basically fell into three camps on future prospects .Some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy .Perhaps the most optimistic view was expressed by Ruan Ming , a visiting professor at Tamkang University 's Department of China Studies who in the 1980s was an assistant to former Chinese Communist Secretary General Hu Yaobang .Ruan stated that {Beijing} [1192] 's basic position on {Taiwan} [1139] has not changed at all since the days of Deng Xiaoping .\" There 's nothing new in what they 're saying . \"The only thing {the Chinese Communists} [1193] are saying , says {Ruan} [1194] , is that {they} [1193] will attack \" if {Taiwan} [1139] makes any sort of formal move toward independence , \" and {Taiwan} [1139] has no need to formalize anything because changing {the country} [1139] 's name would be meaningless .\" No matter what you call yourself , people are still going to call you {Taiwan} [1139] .It 's just like in England - the official name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , but nobody calls it that .And there 's no need to going around shouting , ' {We} [1195] 're a country ! {We} [1195] 're a country ! 'Who in the international community does that ? \"Pragmatism , please\" {Taiwan} [1139] needs to be more pragmatic , \" says {Ruan} [1194] , \" just like {the mainland} [1129] . \"{They} [1196] made a lot of noise ahead of the election trying to sway votes , but once {the election} [1188] was over {they} [1196] backpedaled quickly with the simple statement , \" {We} [1196] 'll wait and see what {they} [1196] say and do . \"The attitude with {them} [1196] , in {Ruan} [1194] 's view , is very pragmatic .Ruan is optimistic about cross-strait relations under the new regime , and states , \" {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] is best positioned to improve cross-strait relations . \"{He} [1197] likens {Chen} [1197] to the staunchly anti-communist Richard Nixon , who was able to normalize ties with {the Chinese Communists} [1193] precisely because {he} [1197] was trusted by the American people .Similarly , when {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] negotiates with {Beijing} [1192] , no one will worry about {him} [1197] selling {Taiwan} [1139] down the river .The noted political commentator Chin Heng - wei , chief editor of {Taiwan} [1139] 's Contemporary Monthly , agreed strongly with Ruan 's comments , and added , \" In {this election} [1188] {the people of Taiwan} [1198]{Taiwan} [1139] were even more concerned about domestic issues than {they} [1198] were about cross-strait relations . \"The most pressing issues facing the new president are education , the environment , \" black gold \" politics -LRB- murky connections between the worlds of politics , business , and organized crime -RRB- , and crime fighting .When Nobel laureate Lee Yuan - tseh came out in support of {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] , implying that {the DPP} [1199] represented \" the progressive forces in society , \" {Chen} [1197] 's support jumped immediately upward .Virtually everyone at {the seminar} [1185] was in agreement that {it} [1185] is neither advisable nor necessary to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue , and that {Taiwan} [1139] need only avoid stirring up Chinese nationalism .Wei Chengsi -LRB- news director at ATV news in {Hong Kong} [1163] and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in {Shanghai} [1191] -RRB- emphasized the fluid nature of {Beijing} [1192] 's policy on {Taiwan} [1139] .He feels that the mainland authorities face many more pressing issues than {Taiwan} [1139] , and that the current tension basically stems from President Lee Teng - hui 's pronouncement on state - to - state relations .Having been through the Tiananmen massacre , Wei felt compelled to warn {the people of Taiwan} [1198]{Taiwan} [1139] , \" You absolutely must not think the way the students did in {Beijing} [1192] in '89 .You must not think that ' {the communists} [1193] wo n't attack because the US wo n't let {them} [1193] , ' and then go out of your way to provoke {them} [1193] to where {they} [1193] no longer have an out .Under the wrong circumstances , failure to display strong Chinese nationalism could spell political suicide for {a Communist Party leader} [1200] , and {he} [1200] might well decide , ' To hell with the US and economic development , I 've got to attack if I 'm to stay in power . 'That would be an incredible disaster . \"Chiu Hsiang - chung , chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal , also advocated cautious optimism .In {his} [1200] view , there has been no fundamental change in the cross-strait relationship , but {he} [1200] listed a few variables that bear close watching .The first is the combination of nationalism and {Jiang Zemin 's} [1201] desire to serve another term as Secretary General of {the Communist Party} [1202] and make {his} [1201] mark on history .Could {he} [1201] attempt to use nationalism to further {his} [1201] ambition ?Second , the People 's Liberation Army hopes to parlay the {Taiwan} [1139] issue into increased influence in domestic politics .Third , {Taiwan} [1139] could make mistakes and give {the Chinese Communists} [1193] an excuse for military action .And a fourth factor is the wishy - washy American support for {Taiwan} [1139] .If all of these variables combined in the wrong way , the military authorities could make a miscalculation that would lead to war .When hawk meets hawkChou Chi - ping -LRB- senior advisor at Business Weekly -RRB- and Tseng Fu - sheng -LRB- general secretary of {the KMT} [1203] 's Department of Mainland Operations -RRB- felt that the future of cross-strait relations is still up in the air .Chou , as a former official with the Straits Exchange Foundation , has had direct dealings with {the Chinese Communists} [1193] .He argued that {the DPP} [1199] 's view of {the mainland} [1129] has always been colored by ideology , and thus take a dim view of the other side .It is true , acknowledges {Chou} [1204] , that {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] has changed {his} [1197] basic stance and now says that {he} [1197] \" will not change {the country} [1139] 's name , declare independence , or seek to enshrine the state - to - state principle in the constitution . \"It is also true that Lee Yuan - tseh -LRB- who is highly respected in {the mainland} [1129] for his academic achievements -RRB- has vouched for the sensibility of {Chen} [1197] 's approach to cross-strait relations .And yes , once again , it is true that {the Chinese Communists} [1193] have muted {their} [1193] rhetoric considerably .Nevertheless , the two sides view each other with suspicion .If {the Chinese Communists} [1193] conclude that {Taiwan} [1139] 's leadership has dropped {its} [1139] insistence on formal independence only to pursue a policy that includes de facto independence as {its} [1139] aim , {Chou} [1204] argued that this will introduce a note of uncertainty into the relationship .Tseng {Fu - sheng} [1205] feels that {Taiwan} [1139] should claim the high ground by holding up {its} [1139] experience in democratization as an example for {the Chinese Communists} [1193] .Says {Tseng} [1206] , \" Reunification depends entirely on whether China can democratize . \"{His} [1205] biggest worry is that the deep gulf between {the DPP and the mainland authorities} [1207] could cause {them} [1207] to misread each other .He stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between {Beijing} [1192] , Washington , and Taipei .If the hawks gained the upper hand at the same time in all three capitals , {opined Tseng} [1206]{Tseng} [1206] , the result could be war .The seminar attendants also examined {Taiwan} [1139] 's domestic situation .Versatile author and cultural commentator Ping Lu offered some very incisive comments regarding the post-election protests outside the KMT headquarters .In demanding that Lee Teng - hui resign as chairman of {the KMT} [1203] to take responsibility for the election defeat , Ping -LRB- herself a second - generation \" mainlander \" -RRB- argued that the protest revealed an ethnic fault line in Taiwanese society .It was a venting of mass frustration on the part of one particular ethnic group , said Ping , noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders .This {group} [1208] feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of {KMT} [1203] rule {they} [1208] have always thought of {themselves} [1208] as a privileged \" majority \" in {Taiwan} [1139] even though in fact {they} [1208] are a minority .They do not identify with {Taiwan} [1139] as {their} [1208] home , and {they} [1208] have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority .In some ways {the election} [1188] has forced {them} [1208] to realize that {they} [1208] truly are a minority .This development should help to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in {Taiwan} [1139] .The participants generally felt that {the election} [1188] was a victory for democracy .On the domestic front , the victory of {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort to banish \" black gold \" from the political arena .In cross-strait relations {Chen} [1197] 's victory spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted within the framework of a civil war between {he} [1197] {KMT} [1203] and {the Chinese Communist Party} [1202] .Reform of {the KMT} [1203] and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in {Taiwan} [1139] .It appears that {the people of Taiwan} [1198]{Taiwan} [1139] have finally taken {their} [1198] first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect .President Chen Travels Abroad-LRB- Chang Chiung -

chang , Central News Agency -RRB-On August 25 {President Chen Shui - bian} [1211] wrapped up {his} [1211] first overseas trip since taking office , swinging through three countries in {Latin America} [1212] and another three in {Africa} [1213] .While in {the Dominican Republic} [1214] to attend {the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia} [1215]{President Hipolito Mejia} [1216] , {Chen} [1197] had a chance to meet with the leaders of many different nations .The {president} [1217] signed joint communiques with {Nicaragua} [1218] , {Gambia} [1219] , and Chad , and agreed to provide US$ 4.6 million worth of loans to {the Dominican Republic} [1214] to serve as a guarantee to help the latter secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund .\" {We} [1220] can not use pressure from {Beijing} [1192] as an excuse for {our} [1220] diplomatic setbacks , \" said Chen , who used concrete actions to demonstrate to {ROC} [1214] 's allies that {our country} [1214] has no intention of pulling back from {its} [1214] diplomatic partnerships ; on the contrary , {the ROC} [1214]{ROC} [1214] will be working even harder than before .Chen {Shui - bian} [1211] left on August 13 for a 13 - day trip that included state visits to the Latin American nations of {the Dominican Republic} [1214] , {Nicaragua} [1218] , {Costa Rica} [1221] , as well as the west African nations of {Gambia} [1219] , {Burkina Faso} [1222] , and Chad .Before boarding the plane on {the 13th} [1223] , {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] delivered a short speech in which {he} [1197] stated , \" {Taiwan} [1139] must stand up and be counted . \"The purpose of {this trip} [1224] , said {Chen} [1197] , is to share {Taiwan} [1139] 's experiences with other countries , and {he} [1197] also indicated the hope that {this trip} [1224] would help to solidify {Taiwan} [1139] 's diplomatic relations .The entourage was the largest ever to accompany an {ROC} [1214] president abroad , and included : Chuang Ming - yao -LRB- secretary - general , National Security Council -RRB- , Tien Hung - mao -LRB- minister of foreign affairs -RRB- , Lin Hsin - yi -LRB- minister of economic affairs -RRB- , Chen Po - chih -LRB- chairman , Council of Economic Planning and Development -RRB- , Chen Hsi - huang -LRB- chairman , Council of Agriculture -RRB- , Chung Chin -LRB- head of the Government Information Office -RRB- , Jeffrey Koo -LRB- chairman of the National Association of Industry and Commerce -RRB- , Wang Yu - tseng -LRB- chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of {the ROC} [1214] -RRB- , and Lin Kun - chung -LRB- chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries -RRB- .There were also many legislators in {the delegation} [1225] , including Hung Chi - chang , Helen Chu , Feng Ting - kuo , and Li Yin - yun .-LRB- Li is soon to assume a position as deputy director of the {ROC} [1214] diplomatic post in Washington , DC . -RRB-The total size of {the delegation} [1225] came to nearly 200 people , including more than 50 journalists .The {president} [1217] kept to a very tight schedule during {the trip} [1224] .After a brief stopover in {Los Angeles} [1226] on {the 13th} [1223] , {Chen} [1197] continued on and reached {the Dominican Republic} [1214] on the 14th .He attended {the presidential inauguration} [1215] there on the 16th , and was able to meet with the leaders and representatives of friendly nations from around the world .On the 17th {he} [1197] continued on to {Nicaragua} [1218] , where {he} [1197] met with {President Arnoldo Aleman} [1227] and delivered a speech to {the Nicaraguan National Assembly} [1210] .On {the 18th} [1228] , presidents {Chen} [1197] and {Aleman} [1227] signed a joint communique before {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] departed for {Costa Rica} [1221] , where {he} [1197] received the Great Cross of Juan Mora Fernandez , a gold medal which is the nation 's highest award .On the 20th {he} [1197] flew across the Atlantic Ocean to {Gambia} [1219] to meet with {Gambian President Yahya Jameh} [1229] before heading on to {Burkina Faso} [1222] and a dinner with President Blaise Compaore .On {the 23rd Chen} [1230]{Chen} [1197] delivered a speech to the Gambian parliament .The next stop on the itinerary was Chad , where {Chen} [1197] dined with Chad 's President Idris Debi .On the 25th {Chen} [1197] and Debi signed a joint communique and held a press conference before heading back to {Taiwan} [1139] slightly ahead of schedule to oversee efforts to deal with the powerful Typhoon Bilis .Chen 's stopover in {Los Angeles} [1226] was a sensitive subject , for {Chen} [1197] had originally planned an informal meeting with several members of the US Congress .After furious protests from {Beijing} [1192] and discouragement from the US State Department , however , {Chen} [1197] canceled the plan just the day before arriving in {Los Angeles} [1226] .A crowd of 500 to 600 Taiwanese living in the United States showed up to greet {the president} [1227] at {his} [1227]{his hotel} [1231] and protest against the US government 's \" caving in to {Beijing} [1192] at the expense of {Taiwan} [1139] . \"When {Chen} [1197] arrived on the 14th in {the Dominican Republic} [1214] , {he} [1197] was greeted at {the airport} [1232] by over 100 representatives of the Taiwanese business community there , and more than 700 Taiwanese residents threw a party for {the president} [1227] that night at {his} [1227]{his hotel} [1231] .The next day , {Chen} [1197] took advantage of {the upcoming presidential inauguration} [1215] to meet with leaders from a number of countries with which {the ROC} [1214]{ROC} [1214] has diplomatic relations , including the vice-president of El Salvador and the second vice president of Panama .On {the 16th Chen} [1230]{Chen} [1197] attended {the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia} [1215]{President Hipolito Mejia} [1216] .The {ROC} [1214] contingent was larger than any other at the ceremony .The {ROC} [1214] currently has diplomatic relations with 29 countries , half of which are located in {Latin America} [1212] and the Caribbean .In recent years , however , {mainland China} [1214] has continually upgraded {its} [1214] trade links with {the ROC} [1214]{ROC} [1214] 's diplomatic partners .The allegiance of a number of these countries may be put to the test in the coming years by various political and economic considerations .In the case of {the Dominican Republic} [1214] , for example , {supporters of President Mejia} [1233]{President Mejia} [1216] announced to the media on the eve of {President Chen} [1197] 's arrival that {mainland China} [1214] was planning to build a large thermal power plant in {their} [1233] country .In addition , {the Dominican Republic} [1214] is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council in 2002 , and will certainly be lobbying for {Beijing} [1192] 's support .This situation could affect relations with {Taiwan} [1139] .On the bright side , {Taiwan} [1139] has scored a few points of {its} [1139] own in this diplomatic tug of war .When {Chen} [1197] arrived in {Costa Rica} [1221] on {the 18th} [1228] , {his} [1197] hosts departed from the pattern of the past few years by promising to support {the ROC s} [1214]{ROC} [1214] s bid for membership in {the United Nations} [1234] .Costa Rica 's President Miguel Rodriguez also accompanied {President Chen} [1197] on a tour of a Taiwanese export processing zone , an orchid farm run by Taiwan Sugar Corporation , and a vocational training school .President {Chen} [1197] departed on the 20th for {Africa} [1213] , where {the ROC} [1214]{ROC} [1214] has eight diplomatic partners .Chen {Shui - bian} [1211] is the first {ROC} [1214] president ever to travel to western {Africa} [1213] .There is little two - way trade between {Taiwan} [1139] and any of the three countries on {Chen} [1197] 's African itinerary .Instead , agricultural and economic assistance constitute the mainstays of {our} [1139] diplomatic ties with these countries .Taiwanese agricultural specialists stationed in {Burkina Faso} [1222] have converted 1,000 hectares of desert to arable land , while Taiwanese specialists sent to {Gambia} [1219] have {successfully transplanted tomatoes , green beans , okra , and various leafy vegetables from Taiwan} [1235]{Taiwan} [1139] and raised {them} [1235] on Gambian soil .In addition to this type of technical assistance , {Taiwan} [1139] has also assisted with various infrastructure projects .Taiwan 's most notable contribution to {Gambia} [1219] 's infrastructure is the main terminal at {the airport} [1232] .Gambian {President Yahya Jameh} [1229] declared {his} [1229] support for admission of {the ROC} [1214] to {the United Nations} [1234] , and as a gesture of goodwill declared that all holders of {ROC} [1214] passports would henceforth automatically be granted 90 - day landing visas upon arrival in {Gambia} [1219] .President {Chen} [1197]{Chen 's trip} [1236] yielded many positive results and generated a lot of very favorable media coverage , but {it} [1236] was not problem - free .First , as {the president} [1227] was preparing to depart {Taiwan} [1139] , the Nicaraguan foreign minister publicly called upon {the ROC} [1214]{ROC} [1214] to make good on the previous administration 's promise of US$ 100 million in assistance .This remark sparked controversy in {Taiwan} [1139] , where some accused the new government of pursuing the same \" checkbook diplomacy \" practiced by its predecessor .Chen {Shui - bian} [1211] responded that while {the new administration} [1237] has not made plans for any new promises of foreign aid , neither will {it} [1237] fail to honor the promises made by {its} [1237] predecessor .Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao stated that the purpose of {Chen} [1197]{Chen 's trip} [1236] was to consolidate {Taiwan} [1139] 's diplomatic ties , and to strengthen friendships by building upon the existing foundation .Tien stressed that {the president} [1227] would not sign any new foreign aid agreements .President {Chen} [1197] received a very warm welcome in {Nicaragua} [1218] , but the local press still mentioned \" checkbook diplomacy \" in reporting on the visit .The {ROC} [1214] 's ambassador to {Nicaragua} [1218] , {Antonio Tsai} [1238] , bluntly argued in a briefing with {Chen} [1197] that {Taiwan} [1139]{Taiwan 's foreign assistance to Nicaragua} [1239]{Nicaragua} [1218] was being misused .According to {Tsai} [1238] , {the assistance} [1239] has been used to build a presidential palace and a new headquarters for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .Opposition politicians charge that the aid has done nothing for everyday people , and Western nations have also been critical .A second problem connected with {the trip} [1224] was the question of who would act in {the president} [1227] 's stead while {he} [1197] was out of {the country} [1218] .Concern over {this issue} [1240] prompted {President Chen} [1197] to state before {his} [1197] departure that {he} [1197] would remain commander - in - chief of the military forces , and that {he} [1197] would maintain hot lines to every cabinet - level agency .The {president} [1217] said that there was no need for an acting president because {he} [1197] had taken painstaking precautions to ensure domestic political stability during {his} [1197] absence .So is {Taiwan} [1139] 's diplomacy a way of giving back to the international community ?Or is it checkbook diplomacy ?{Ambassador - without - portfolio Lu Yi - cheng} [1241] wrote an article in which {he} [1241] argued that foreign aid has always been universally recognized as a regular tool of diplomacy as well as a humanitarian necessity , and there is no reason why {Taiwan} [1139] should have to steer clear of {it} [1139] .He pointed out that {the world 's developed nations} [1234] spend an average of 0.24 % of GNP on foreign aid , as opposed to 0.17 % in {Taiwan} [1139] 's case .In view of {Taiwan} [1139] 's economic strength , argued {Lu} [1241] , {our foreign aid expenditures} [1242] need not be reduced ; in fact , {they} [1242] should even be raised somewhat .The {ROC} [1214] has been criticized a lot in recent years for pursuing checkbook diplomacy , so there was no surprise when {this issue} [1240] cropped up in connection with {the president} [1227]{the president 's trip} [1236] .The question of an acting president , however , has never before been a matter of concern .This situation is to some degree a reflection of the fact that the public still has doubts about {the new administration} [1237] 's ability to govern .This is an important point that is worth keeping in mind .Paralympics Offer Stage for Taiwan PerformersClosing ceremonies for the 2000 Sydney Paralympics were held on October 29 .Nearly 4000 athletes from more than one hundred and twenty countries participated .This event , a manifestation of the ideal that \" the flame burns in the body , mind , and spirit of every individual , \" broke down international barriers and was an admirable example of the global village in operation .The {ROC} [1214] team took one gold , two silvers , and four bronzes , marking the first time any {Taiwan} [1139] athlete has returned from an Olympic games with a gold .Also , as part of the events , {Taiwan} [1139] 's Crescent Moon Dance Troupe , made up of handicapped persons , was the only foreign troupe invited by {the Australian government} [1243] to participate in the Paralympic Arts Festival .But even more important than these honors was the spirit of overcoming all obstacles and facing life with courage that shone through during the Paralympics .The just - completed Paralympics were enriched by ethnic flavorings .The opening ceremony on October 18 was in the form of a welcoming for aboriginal elders .Amidst a festive atmosphere , the athletes entered the stadium by categories - one group in wheelchairs , another on crutches , another led by guide dogs .The events at the 12 - day Paralympics were packed with spectators .The 1.1 million tickets sold show the extent to which everyone took the games seriously .The {host government} [1243] even set up a huge TV screen in Darwin , which is the port of entry for the most visitors to Australia , to broadcast the games live .The games were also a platform for the idea of the welfare state caring for disadvantaged groups , and for emphasizing how handicapped persons can break through barriers and limitations .On October 14 , {Taiwan} [1139]{Taiwan 's Crescent Moon Dance Company} [1244] created a sensation with {their} [1244] performance \" Standing on the Highest Peak , \" performed in traditional vests and short skirts as worn by indigenous people in {Taiwan} [1139] .After the 10 - minute performance ended , the hall was rocked by thunderous applause .The standing ovation lasted three minutes , and some people were even moved to tears .The Crescent Moon Dance Company has only been in operation for four years .Organized by a group of amputee women on a nonprofessional basis , {it} [1245] is {the world 's first dance troupe of its kind} [1246]{its} [1245] kind .As {its} [1245] manifesto reads : \" One with no voice may nonetheless sing .One with no wings may nonetheless soar .One with no limbs may nonetheless dance .The crescent moon and the full moon are the moon just the same , and equally beautiful . \"{The troupe} [1246] also delighted Sydney citizens with a performance at the Sydney City Hall on October 19 .In the competition , host country Australia took the most medals , including 64 golds.Among {the ROC} [1214] 's medals , the gold - the first ever for {Taiwan} [1139] - was won by Chiang Chih - chung .With a throw of 57.28 meters , {Chiang} [1247] shattered the world record for the javelin in the F12 visually - impaired class .Chiang , a member of the Bunun indigenous people , received a traditional hero 's welcome home from the Bunun of Sanmin Rural Township in Kaohsiung County .During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised {Chiang} [1247] for {his} [1247] glorious deeds .Meanwhile , the {ROC} [1214] table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time .In the wheelchair men 's doubles class 5 event , {Chou Chang - sheng} [1248] and Lin Yen - hung took the silver , while {Chou} [1248] won another silver in the men 's singles .The men 's class 9 team for persons with non-leg - related disabilities and the women 's wheelchair team of combined classes 4 and 5 took bronzes in team events , while Li Ching - chung -LRB- men 's judo class 1 -RRB- and Lu Li - hua -LRB- women 's powerlifting class 1 -RRB- garnered individual bronzes .Among Asian countries , {South Korea} [1249] turned in the best performance , taking five gold medals .This was due in part to the fact that {the ROK government} [1249] has provided special coaching in wheelchair table tennis to soldiers injured in service .Indeed , many handicapped competitors from other nations besides the ROK were retired veterans .Their {pensions} [1250] allow {them} [1250] free time to train , and through athletics {they} [1250] bring meaning to {their} [1250] lives and glory to {their} [1250] countries .Taiwan team members , on the other hand , come from a variety of backgrounds , and train out of personal interest .They must give up working if {they} [1250] wish to train full - time .The South Korean team of veterans , by overcoming {their} [1250] injuries to give a display of athleticism at the international level , have emerged from the shadow of war and transformed {their} [1250] handicaps into glorious results .This example should provide food for thought to the disabled and sports communities in the future .Pali : Storied Past , Uncertain Future-LRB- Lin I - hsien / photos by Diago Chiu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-I wonder if {Pali} [1251] is jealous of {Tanshui} [1252] .I ask because fate has treated these two towns , separated only by the mouth of the Tanshui River , very differently .Tanshui is celebrated in poems , songs , paintings , and lovers ' memories of its scenic views .Pali has donuts , mussels , a garbage landfill , and troubles which have yet to be revealed to {the outside world} [1253] .Have you heard this legend ?Liao Tianding , {Taiwan} [1139] 's Robin Hood , fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in {Pali} [1251] , where {he} [1254] fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age 27 , was murdered in the Monkey Cave at Laochienkeng -LRB- in Pali Rural Township -RRB- by one of {his} [1254] best friends .Countless legends grew up around {Liao} [1255] after {his} [1255] death , and {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] began to worship {his} [1255] spirit .In 1958 , {his} [1255] small burial plot was converted into {a huge temple} [1257] .He has followers scattered far and wide , and every year on the special day appointed for making offerings at {his} [1255]{his temple} [1257] -LRB- the 26th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar -RRB- , the grounds are packed with cars and visitors .The {Ko} [1255]{Ko brothers} [1258] , now in {their} [1258] 60s , recall {their} [1258] impressions of a visit to the Liao Tianding gravesite : \" {It} [1259] must have been 30 years ago , {we} [1260] used to go there just for the fun of {it} [1259] .The road in front of {the temple} [1257] was n't so wide then , and what a crowd !{People} [1261] were so jammed in you could n't move . \"{They} [1261] also recall that the Pali of those days was a place in which most people lived by fishing , farming , or petty trading .The {elder Ko} [1255] gives a thumbs - up and declares : \" That 's why I always say that {a can - do guy like Liao Tianding} [1262] must be looking after {us} [1260] , so that {we} [1260] have developed and can even earn money from the tourists . \"Yet , {he} [1262] may not know about {Pali} [1251] 's real heyday , long in the past .The days of the sailing shipsPali was originally called Palifen , a transliteration of the place name used by the Ketagalan indigenous people .Located on the {northwest} [1263] corner of {Taiwan} [1139] , {Pali} [1251] faces the Taiwan Strait to {the northwest} [1263] , rests against Mt. Kuanyin to the southeast , and looks across the river toward Tanshui to the northeast .Though {it} [1264] does n't have much of a hinterland , {its} [1264] geographic location has proved historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the Ta - pen - keng and Shih - san - hang archeological sites .Later , when {Han Chinese} [1265] began trickling across to {Taiwan} [1139] , {they} [1265] mainly settled along rivers .Because {Pali} [1251] is relatively close to {the mainland} [1266] and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that {it} [1267] does not have a natural harbor , in 1757 the Qing court designated {it} [1267] to be one of {Taiwan} [1139] 's small number of official ports for maritime transport with {the mainland} [1266] .Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of {Pali} [1251] .However , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in 1796 , {Pali} [1251] began to give way in importance to {Tanshui} [1252] , located just across the river .Once mainly dependent on fishing , {Pali} [1251] increasingly came to rely on farming .But the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .While {the hardy people of Pali} [1268]{Pali} [1251] barely kept {their} [1268] stomachs filled , {their} [1268] children and grandchildren left in search of a better life .Neither the Japanese occupation -LRB- which began in 1895 -RRB- nor the return to Chinese rule -LRB- in 1945 -RRB- brought much joy or change to this rural area .But in the 1970s , urban planning came to {Pali} [1251] .It proved to be the prelude to a symphony -LRB- or perhaps cacophony -RRB- of transformation .Changing the rhythm of {Pali} [1251] lifeDuring the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in {Taipei} [1269] , builders put up self - described \" villas \" and \" mansions \" -LRB- apartment blocks , in fact -RRB- one after another in {Pali} [1251] .Also , to try to reduce the outflow of population from {Pali} [1251] and to get the stagnant local economy moving , {the government} [1249] decided to link this formerly isolated village to {the outside world} [1253] .What had been Chungshan Road was turned into Provincial Highway #15 , and the opening of the Kuantu Bridge to traffic linked {Pali} [1251] directly to the busy {Taipei} [1269] districts of Shilin and Peitou .Gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , {Pali} [1251] began to dream of a tourism boom .But fortune had other things in store .In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of {Pali} [1251] , {the plan to develop tourism in Pali} [1270]{Pali} [1251] was scrapped overnight .The government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility .Then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western {Taiwan} [1139] for construction purposes , and {a harbor} [1271] was built on the Pali coast for the convenience of gravel transporters .In accordance with {the urban plan} [1272] , new streets were cut this way and that through Pali 's land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways .The sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .In 1997 , {the Hsiachuotzu garbage landfill} [1273] formally opened , and {it} [1273] became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of {Pali} [1251] .This rural township , which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in {Taipei County} [1274] , seemed resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered by many outlying areas -RRB- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others .It is only recently that the residents of Hsiachuotsu , unable to stand the smell , have begun to protest .Lin Yi - hung , born and raised in {Pali} [1251] , stands on the roof of {his} [1275] house and looks across to the beach where {he} [1275] used to run and play {as a child} [1276] .He can not help but sigh , {as} [1276] {he} [1275] looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that have come to this area : \" These construction projects have destroyed the relationship we people of {Pali} [1251] used to have with {the sea} [1277] . \"It 's certainly true that {a lot of people here} [1278] thought {they} [1278] would get rich from the rezoning .But just because {land increases in value} [1279] does n't mean someone will buy {it} [1279] , and just because apartment complexes are built does n't mean there are people who want to live there .Worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned in the struggle over divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money is involved .Lin concludes : \" I am not by any means opposed to development .But development is not necessarily the same as progress .Can {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] really survive change of this magnitude ? \"All part of {the plan} [1272] ?One after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of Pali residents .But so far the only things {Pali} [1251] folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an \" otherworldly \" kind .The new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious to escape from Taipei City and return to nature .But at the same time , verdant Mt. Kuanyin - named for its uncanny resemblance to the deity Kuanyin - is covered with columbariums and cemeteries .Even {Kuanyin} [1280] , worshipped for {her} [1280] limitless compassion and mercy , must be creasing {her} [1280] brow at this rampant overuse of {the mountain} [1281] .Chen {Chien - kuo , a secretary in the Pali Rural Township government} [1282]{the Pali Rural Township government} [1283] , says facetiously : \" What can {we} [1283] do ? {We} [1283] have the mountains behind {us} [1283]{us and} [1284] the sea in front .People say the fengshui is good here , so {they} [1284] come . \"{He} [1282] adds , in a far less amused tone , that {the government} [1249] has been talking about making Mt. Kuanyin a national park for a long time , and has banned construction or use of {the mountain} [1281] .But after 30 years , {the park plan} [1270] is still a non-starter , and meanwhile many cemeteries and colum - bariums have \" snuck in . \"\" Nobody seems to care about {our Pali} [1251]{our} [1285] {Pali} [1251] , and {we} [1285] are very remote , so {people} [1286] just dump what {they} [1286] do n't want out here .We say that this is why {we} [1285] not only have a water pollution treatment plant and a garbage landfill , but also five nursing homes and hospices for the terminally ill . \"Take the Taipei Happy Mountain Colony for example .This venerable institution was first used to house leprosy victims , who met only fear and loathing elsewhere .In 1932 , a British missionary founded this home - over the strong opposition of the local gentry - to offer leprosy victims a place to live in dignity and find warmth away from the cold outside world .Today , {Happy Mountain} [1281] is a home for physically and mentally challenged young people , and the simple old structure , surrounded by greenery , rings with the laughter of children .Li Li - chuan , who works at {Happy Mountain} [1281] , was born and raised right here in {Pali} [1251] .Her family home is not far from the chil - dren 's home .\" When I was small I used to come here to play .All {the adults} [1287] called the kids ' empty - headed . 'I was small , and did n't know any better , so I just called {them} [1287] that too . \"Stroking the head of a sleeping child with {hydrocephalus} [1288] , {she} [1288] says : \" {He} [1289] is so cute when {he} [1289] smiles ! \"Located on the margins of the island of {Taiwan} [1139] , {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] take it in stride that {they} [1256] must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast off by society - waste water , trash , the deceased , and victims of diseases that society would prefer not to see at all .And there is no sign this situation will end : Reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved to Linkou for a land reclamation project there will be trucked along Provincial Highway #15 - right through the heart of {Pali} [1251] .Serving Greater Taipei\" I believe , \" says Lin Yi - hung , \" that {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] understand that this is just the way society works -the interests of the few are sacrificed so that the majority can be better off . \"Thus , in urban plans {Pali} [1251] is always assigned the role of serving {Taipei} [1269] .\" But {the government} [1249] should think carefully about whether {they} [1249] are using the right methods or not .There are no real comprehensive policies , just short - term trade - offs of interests .There are a lot of great - sounding plans , but what do {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] get out of {them} [1256] ?It 's like the port {they} [1256] built for transporting gravel .There are a lot of bright promises for the future , raising people 's hopes , but who knows what the final result will really be ? \"{Chang Tsu - chou} [1290] , now in {his} [1290] 70s , has been a secretary in {the rural township government} [1249] for more than 30 years , and loves {Pali} [1251] more than words can say .\" I was first sent here to work in {the Kuomintang Public Service Department} [1291] .When I came here , {they} [1292] were only selling about 30 newspapers in all of {Pali} [1251] .But I went all out to promote newspaper sales , and by the time I left {the department} [1291] , {they} [1292] were selling more than 1000 ! \"He has great confidence in {Pali} [1251] 's future , and believes {the new harbor} [1271] will bring prosperity .\" {The government} [1249] says that {the first phase} [1293] is for transporting gravel , but when {the third phase} [1293] is completed a lot of goods will be shipped in and out of here .At that time , {Pali} [1251] should really be hopping ! \"Pali , known as \" the home of green bamboo shoots \" for {its} [1294] famous local vegetable , is - like many remote areas all over {Taiwan} [1139] - accepting the pain and enjoying the pleasures of life in the space between hopeful expectations and disappointing letdowns .And , being marginal , {it} [1294] also must live with burdens that {the citizens themselves} [1295] do not want .Uncertain whether to makes fists or open {their} [1295] arms , the people of {Pali} [1251] watch , perplexed , as {the great wheel of our times} [1296] leaves {its} [1296] tracks through {their} [1295] rural township .Yet these are hardy people , who will always bounce back with a smile to face the unknown future , be it filled with troubles or glory .Pali Facts and FiguresPali Rural Township -LRB- also spelled Bali -RRB- is located at the northwestern edge of the Taipei Basin , on the western bank of the mouth of the Tanshui River .It has an area of 39.5 square kilometers and a population of just over 28,000 .It is one of the 29 townships under the jurisdiction of {Taipei County} [1274] .Pali produces wax apples , green bamboo shoots , and wendan pomelo which are famous far and wide for their delicate texture and sweetness .In addition , Chinese raspberries and strawberry pears are now being cultivated , with promising results so far .The main attractions include the so - called \" eight views of {Pali} [1251] , \" the ferry boat scenic tour , hiking on {Mt.

              "'In the summer of 2005 , a picture that {people} [1] have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major {Hong Kong} [2] media .With {their} [1] unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused {Hong Kong} [2] to be a focus of worldwide attention .The world \\'s fifth {Disney} [3] park will soon open to the public here .The most important thing about {Disney} [3] is that {it} [3] is a global brand .Well , for several years , although {it} [3] was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed {Hong Kong} [2] with new respect .Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of {Hong Kong Disneyland} [4] .The construction of {Hong Kong Disneyland} [4] began two years ago , in 2003 .In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of {Lantau Island} [5] that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .One .Since then , {this area} [6] has become a prohibited zone in {Hong Kong} [2] .As {its} [6] neighbor on {Lantau Island} [5] , {Hong Kong International Airport} [7] had to change {its} [7] flight routes to make {this area} [6] a no - fly zone .Mickey Mouse \\'s new home , settling on Chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .There \\'s only one month left before the opening of {Hong Kong Disneyland} [4] on September 12 {.The subway to Disney} [8]{Disney} [9] has already been constructed .At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for {Disney} [9] on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy {the park} [10] when {it} [8] first opens .Meanwhile , the {Disney} [9] subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as {the park} [10] .For two years , {Disney} [9] has constantly maintained {its} [9] mystery .No media have been allowed to enter for photos .We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward {Disney} [9] , trying to experience {this mysterious park} [10] from close by .However , before any of the {Disney} [9] symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by {a security guard} [11] at the intersection of the road towards {Disney} [9] .On {our} [12] way back , the taxi driver gave {us} [12] an explanation after understanding {our} [12] intentions .Er , according to what {the security guard} [11] said , for the time before everything is officially , opened , , {no cars} [13] can enter unless {they} [13] have special permission .No one can enter otherwise .Video recording is especially forbidden .Ah , everything is top secret .If pictures are taken without permission , {%pw} [14] that is to say , {it} [14] will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .Although Disney Corporation chose {Hong Kong} [15] as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between {Hong Kong} [15] and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit {Hong Kong} [15] .From the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists , have come to {Hong Kong} [15] .Well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .At this point , it has been about two years .Also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .Hong {Kong} [15] was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today \\'s international metropolis .Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .When in {Hong Kong} [15] , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in Mong Kok .You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay , where all deities gather .You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in {Hong Kong} [15] .You can ascend Victoria Peak to get a panoramic view of {Victoria Harbor} [16] \\'s beautiful scenery .Or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city \\'s blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .After dark , cruise {Victoria Harbor} [16] at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .Every corner of {Hong Kong} [15] is filled with fun .Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the {Hong Kong} [15] tourism industry bring us ?Over the past 28 years , {the Ocean Park} [17] has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to {Hong Kong} [15] .Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird \\'s eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of {Hong Kong Island} [18] and the South China Sea .These items , which were the pride of {the Ocean Park} [17] , have made {this place} [19] the most popular tourist attraction in {Hong Kong} [15] for some time .However , since {Disney} [20] entered {Hong Kong} [15] , {the Ocean Park} [17] , sharing the same city as {Disney} [20] , has felt the pressure of competition .To improve {the park} [17] \\'s brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .That is , {the entire park} [17] will be divided into seven sections for renovation .Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .It seems that {those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center} [21] will also be renovated after several years .Are {they} [21] going to be different from what {they} [21] are now ?{They} [21] will be , in ten years .Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .It looks like {we} [22] will also bring in whales .Er , {we} [22] will implement {this plan} [23] as soon as {it} [23] is approved by the government .Groundbreaking is expected to start next year .Yes .The area of {Hong Kong} [15] is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .The population is dense .Natural resources are relatively scarce .However , {the clever Hong Kong people} [24]{Hong Kong} [15] people will utilize all resources {they} [24] have created for developing the {Hong Kong} [15] tourism industry .Among these is {the Avenue of Stars} [25] .Entering {Hollywood} [26]{Hollywood of the East} [27]{the East} [28] ,here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .He is my .She is my Goddess , ah .Please stay with {us} [22] on New World Travel .Hong {Kong} [15] has always worn the crown of {Hollywood} [26]{Hollywood of the East} [27]{the East} [28] .Over the past 100 years of film history , {Hong Kong} [15] cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .They have shortened the distance between {Hong Kong} [15] and {the world} [29] .Hong Kong movies have even become a window for {the world} [29] to see {Hong Kong} [15] , which have made the image of metropolitan {Hong Kong} [15] more prominent internationally .For this reason , in 2004 , on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor , the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed {the Avenue of Stars} [25] , memorializing {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong \\'s} [15] 100 - year film history .Here , {tourists} [30] can learn about {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong \\'s} [15] film history , and can come up close with the stars in {their} [30] mind .Hong {Kong} [15] is a busy metropolis .Even at dusk , {the city} [15] \\'s pulse never stops beating .Across from {the Avenue of Stars} [25] , a special performance is staged every weekend .%pw As {our} [31] {Victoria Harbor} [32] is %pw very famous , and , er , {our} [31]{our nightscape} [33] is already very beautiful , by what means could {we} [31] enhance the dynamic beauty of {our} [31]{our nightscape} [33] ?So , one idea was to transform {Victoria Harbor} [32] into a performance stage .Er , each key building is like a performer .It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza , Bank of {China} [34] Tower , at 8:00 every Saturday night , HSBC Main Building .Their performances will be on schedule .Center of {the East Central .Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island} [35] reveal {themselves} [35] one by one , participating in {the show in full splendor} [36] , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to {the light show} [36] .Some , er , cities have consulted with us .Uh-huh .Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .Yes .The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building \\'s reward .Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of {Hong Kong} [37] hopes to be involved , so that {the Hong Kong tourism industry} [38]{Hong Kong} [37] tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .Hong Kong Wetland Park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of {the Hong Kong SAR government} [39] for advancing {the Hong Kong tourism industry} [38]{Hong Kong} [37] tourism industry .This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by {the Hong Kong government} [39] for {its} [39] people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .Hong {Kong Wetland Park} [40] covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor \\'s center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .In the indoor exhibition hall , {tourists} [41] can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of {the world} [42] , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .Outdoors , {they} [41] can also personally experience wetland ecology ., er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,but behind me is {our Wetland Park} [40]{our} [43] {Wetland Park} [40] .Ha , entirely different .Quite primitive ,er , a fresh water swamp ,er , the Wetland Park Exploration Center .Lastly , farthest away you can see Putian of {Shenzhen} [44] .Then , , on {the bridge} [45] is {Hong Kong} [15] and outside is {Shenzhen} [44] .You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in {our} [43] daily life .Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .Ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many {Hong Kong} [15] children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .Look over there .They are going to be ripe soon .The long one over there .Oh .Yes ., with ears , ah .Where ?Ah , here .Perhaps there will be an introduction so that {children} [46] will know the names of the crops when {they} [46] see {them} [46] ., let {them} [46] get some understanding .Mai Po Marshes adjacent to {Wetland Park} [40] is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong \\'s} [15] skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in {Hong Kong} [15] {Wetland Park} [40] .These have become the best spots to observe birds .Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .It is an endangered bird species throughout {the world} [42] .Uh-huh .Ah , there are only about 1,500 in {the world} [42] .Wow .Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of {them} [47] come to {Hong Kong} [15] to spend the winter .Some of {them} [47] , er , have stayed in {Hong Kong} [15] {Wetland Park} [40]{Wetland Park .Uh} [40]-huh .So , {our} [48] park \\'s logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people \\'s attention .Uh-huh .Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .They will complete {the park} [40] \\'s entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign .Ah , {we} [48] have established the year 2006 as {Discover Hong Kong} [15]{Discover Hong Kong Year} [49] .Why is that ?Because , as everyone knows , {our} [48] Disneyland will open in September of this year .In addition , {we} [48] will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to {the Giant Buddha} [50] .They add to what {we} [48] already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .Moreover , er , {we} [48] are including {our} [48] software .Hong {Kong} [15] \\'s software is very well known .Like what \\'s used in {our} [48] Symphony of Lights .We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 {Discover Hong Kong Year} [49] .Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .Because your line connects us with two --In recent years , {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong \\'s} [15] tourist attractions have gradually moved from {Hong Kong Island} [18] to Kowloon and {the New Territory} [51] .Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on {Lantau Island} [18] of {the New Territory} [51] .For this reason , {Lantau Island} [18] has become a new {Hong Kong} [15] tourism popular spot .The earliest to settle here was this world \\'s largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .Therefore , {Hong Kong} [15]{Hong Kong \\'s} [15] Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of {China} [34] , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in {the east} [28] , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of {China} [34] .As a result , {this place} [19] has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .However , to {common tourists} [52] , more of what {this place} [19] brings {them} [52] is wonder and awe .Since {this giant bronze Buddha} [50] settled on {Lantau Island} [18] , {the world} [29] renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and {Disneyland} [53] have also been constructed here in succession .The {important status of Lantau Island} [54]{Lantau Island} [18] is increasingly apparent .No , {it} [54] was totally inaccessible in the past .In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting {Hong Kong} [15] , {Zhuhai} [55] , and {Macao} [56] .In 1992 --Could n\\'t go in summer --So , after their return , {Macao} [56] , and {Hong Kong} [15] , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .It \\'s extremely troublesome to get there via land .One has to go up to {Shenzhen} [44] , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to {Zhuhai} [55] , then pass through {Zhuhai} [55] to get to {Macao} [56] .For a {Hong Kong} [15] person choosing to go there via land , it \\'s extremely inconvenient .A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .With {this bridge} [57] , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .This is what we have seen since 1999 .Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .Well , originally the construction of the new --With this new {Hong Kong} [15] - {Zhuhai} [55] - {Macao} [56] bridge that basically leads to all three places , {Hong Kong} [15] , {Macao} [56] , and {Zhuhai} [55] , basically , at the start of {the bridge} [45] , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .Macao is {this way} [58] , and {Zhuhai} [55] is {this way} [58] .From the perspective of either {Hong Kong} [15] , {Macao} [56] , or {Zhuhai} [55] , our concept is a tourism zone .Er , %pw {Zhuhai} [55] for sightseeing tours , {Macao} [56] for entertainment , and we have {Disneyland} [53] and , other attractions in {Hong Kong} [15] .Each {place} [59] has different attractions of {its} [59] own .So , with {this bridge} [57] , when {some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries} [60]{mainland China} [61] or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems {they} [60] can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .Once {the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge} [62]{Macao} [56] bridge is built ,

working on {this cold case} [111] /.Thanks for spending time with {us} [110] tonight doctor /.We understand since {Thelma} [112] left your laboratories you \\'ve now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.is that true /?Well hi {Paula} [113] /.yes {we} [114] have /.Uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago {our} [114]{our analysts and historians} [115] got to work on {that /.and} [116] {they} [115] were able to wittle {it} [116] down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.and at this point {they} [115] \\'ve wittled {it} [116] down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.So we \\'ve gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.So how much easier will that make it for you to unlock {this case} [111] , do you think /?Well I think {it} [111] \\'ll help quite a bit /.Um any time {you \\'ve} [117] got a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they \\'re in pretty good condition such as this one is , it \\'s mummified remains /.We have some soft tissue we can deal with /.so we can look at the color of the hair /.we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.and that \\'s where we \\'re going to now /.So in the interest of full disclosure what I know about forensics is basically what I \\'ve learned on CSI /.and one would think that because you \\'ve got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential DNA match with what {you \\'ve} [117] found in the ice /.Is it not that simple /?Well no no it \\'s not that simple /.Um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what {we} [118] \\'re looking at /.And what {we} [118] want to do is {we} [118] do n\\'t want to just look at the material evidence that {we} [118] have and immediately um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.What {we} [118] want to do is have {the evidence} [119] speak for {itself} [119] /.and when we look at {this individual} [120] as we \\'ve done the biological profile looking at {his} [121] remains {his} [121] bones {his} [121] teeth and the material evidence /.and what we \\'re able to tell from {this individual} [120] is that {he} [121] died in {his} [121] twenties {he} [121] stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um {he} [121] sustained massive trauma to {his} [121] body on impact /.And {he} [121] \\'s Caucasoid male /.and so {we} [122] know much more now just one week later than what {we} [122] did when {he} [121] came in about eight days ago /.So the most important question is when do you think you \\'re going to know exactly who {he} [121] is /?Well that \\'s the most commonly asked question that we have /.and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.Nobody knows for sure exactly when {we} [122] \\'ll identify {him} [121] /.What it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for successful identification /.If I were to give my best opinion in this it would be a few weeks to a few months /.Well {we} [123] \\'ll be keeping {our} [123] fingers crossed for you /.Know how hard you all are working in the

intelligence /.This investigation has been stymied stopped , obstructions thrown up every step of the way /.That \\'s the real slap in the face /.that \\'s the slap in the face /.And today the American people are going to see a little bit of light /.What \\'s really going on is {Democrats} [178] feel emboldened by the indictment of Vice President Cheney \\'s former chief of staff believing this is {their} [178] chance to issue a broader indictment of {the Bush administration} [177] /.We have lost over two thousand of our best and bravest /.over fifteen thousand have been seriously wounded /.We are spending more than six million dollars a month with no end in sight /.and {this Republican led Senate intelligence committee} [175]{Senate} [166] intelligence committee refuses to even ask the hard questions about the misinformation /-Republicans insist {they} [175] \\'re completing the investigation /.and this is just a distraction /.This is purely political /.This is settling an old political score /.Democrats say {they} [175] also want to signal {they} [175] \\'re ready to stand up to the Republican majority and may even filibuster {the president} [168] \\'s latest {Supreme Court} [171] pick {Samuel Alito} [170] a move that would make these events seem like the opening fireworks in a much nastier battle /.Ed Henry CNN Capitol Hill /.So do you think we just saw the outlines to what the midterm election battlelines might look like /?A debate that \\'s likely to rage on for many many months to come /.Turning our attention now to something that has a lot of folks concerned /.You \\'ve been hearing an awful lot about avian or bird flu /.The most common and deadly form has already spread in birds from {South Asia} [179] to Europe /.And now there is real concern that the virus could mutate and become devastating to humans /.In fact some health experts say it \\'s just a matter of time /.Today {President Bush} [176] unveiled {a seven point one billion dollar plan to prepare for a possible flu pandemic} [180] /.Now much of {that money} [180] would go toward stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million healthcare workers and other first responders speeding up production of vaccines and buying the anti-viral drugs Tamoflu and Rolenzo which in some cases prevent flu infection /.And {we} [181] now turn to senior medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupto who has just gotten back from {South Asia} [179] where {bird flu} [182] has in the past two years killed at least sixty - two people about half of those who were struck with it /.Hundreds of millions of birds around the world have been destroyed to try to contain the disease /.And {Dr. Gupto} [183] now just joins {us} [181] from {the Emory University hospital in Atlanta} [184] /.Always good to see you doctor /.So /-Thanks /.I know you \\'ve had a chance to study the plan {the president} [176] put forth today /.Does it go far enough in your estimation /?You know what \\'s sort of interesting {Paula} [185] /.on one hand it is remarkable that {the president} [176] is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n\\'t exist yet {/.Pandemic flu} [186] does n\\'t exist yet /.But a lot of people are talking about {it} [186] /.and I think that \\'s remarkable to a lot of people eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of {bird flu} [182] happens that takes probably a lot more money and really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.The other thing {Paula} [185] really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that {we} [187] \\'re a lot better at taking care of patients now than {we} [187] were in nineteen eighteen , {we} [187] have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in {the hospital behind me} [184] that can take care of critically ill patients /.The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so {we} [187] just do n\\'t have the surge capacity and that \\'s going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic {Paula} [185] /.Uh let \\'s talk about the other problem of the plan where {the president} [176] wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like {Tamaflu and Rolenza} [188] /.Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n\\'t even presented itself /?here \\'s the important thing about that /.We do n\\'t know for sure /.A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on {Tamaflu and Rolenza} [188] /.These are antiviral drugs /.they are not vaccines /.They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad {the flu} [189] might effect you uh try to lessen {its} [189] impact /.But we only know that {it} [189] might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.So it \\'s just theoretical really for the most part that those will work {Paula} [185] /.Dr. {Sanjay Gupto} [183] thanks for the update /.By the way are you catching a cold /?A a little bit /.You know I just got back /.and the ninteen hour plane ride /.Not bird flu though /.I can assure you that {Paula} [185] /.Chicken soup /.That \\'s right /.Just what the doctor ordered

say happened /?you know it \\'s a pretty long scenario /.We have a lot of details /.Um you know {the main thing} [289] to to sum {it} [289] up as you know {Joran} [284] how {he} [284] entered {this establishment} [290] /.I believe that you know if you enter on the right side you have to have a valid ID /.You enter {Carlos N\\'} [291]{Carlos N\\' Charlie} [292] \\'s on {the left side} [293] you must have some type of I do n\\'t know if it \\'s a VIP pass or what to enter {/.but Joran} [294]{Joran} [284] enters {the establishment} [290] on {the left side} [293] +approaches these group of

[284] around and these other tourists and was able to point out {Satish} [288] and {Deepak} [295] Kalpoe /.They \\'re sitting ironically in the same corner the same stools that {they} [296] were seated at in the picture that \\'s been all over international media /.So that must be {their} [296] spot where {they} [296] wait while {Joran} [284] is working /.And um you know it was so interesting how everyone in the casino knew {Joran} [284]{Joran /.you} [285] know {he} [285] knew everyone was greeting all the guys with this grip handshake /.All {the girls} [297] approach {him} [285] with a kiss on the cheek /.It was interesting how um you know {he} [285] was able to order these group of girls by just merely leaning over {the bar} [298] and ordering three shots of one fifty - one one for {himself} [285] and three for the tourists with no money /.So {he} [285] \\'s got an open uh tab at {Carlos N\\'} [291] Charlie \\'s /.able to run a tab /.And you know then you notice that in a evening \\'s proceeding {he} [285] \\'s even approaching {these girls} [297] getting close to closing time /.Did /.So that \\'s another unique pattern that {he} [285] has /.did {she} [299] say uh anything about uh violence /?No {she} [299] did n\\'t say anything about violence /.but what I was looking for was a history is a predatory type behavior which I think {Joran} [284] and {Deepak} [295] and {Satish} [288] have and how tightly connected the three are /.Now i- /.Joining me now is the private investigator who has been uh working with {Natalee} [259] \\'s family TJ Ward and his associate

/.how} [303] does that really impact {the case} [304] /?Well {it} [304] just shows it \\'s a pattern of um what {his} [303] activity is when {he} [303] hangs out at {Carlos N\\'} [291]{Carlos N\\' Charlie} [292]{Charlie} [292] \\'s /.I mean and trying to pick {women} [305] up and take {them} [305] from {the bar} [298] and whatever {he} [303] \\'s doing with {them} [305] after that /.But if there \\'s no violence associated with that does that help you in the investigation /?Well again {we} [302] do n\\'t think there was a violent issue with {him} [303] with {Natalee} [259] /.We think

well {we} [302] feel something happened when {Natalee} [259] was with {them} [306] /.What do you mean by that {/?Either} [307] {she} [307] either passed out regurgitated /.um something had happened /.And on top of that now there \\'s a statement that \\'s come up from Joran Van Der Sloot that {he} [308] \\'s given to {the police} [309] uh one of twenty - two statements {he} [308] \\'s given by the way that um {Deepak} [295] had uh raped {her} [295] and killed {her} [295] on the beach /.So at this point what {the police} [309] have you know again {we} [310] \\'re unaware because {we} [310] \\'re not getting any information from law enforcement /.so {we} [310] have to go on the course of information that {we} [310] \\'re gathering on behalf of the family /.Well let me ask Harold how do

statement} [311] was /.TJ just so I \\'m clear where are you getting that from that {that statement} [311] was made by {Joran} [284] about {Deepak} [295] /?I have seen a copy of {the statement} [311] from one of the local newspapers here um Diario /.Um {Jossy Mansur} [312] produced and showed me a copy of {that statement} [311] that uh Joran Van Der Sloot made um the last time that I was here in Aruba /.and uh {he} [312] conveyed it from Dutch into English and uh showed me {the statement} [311] /.Uh TJ are you in any trouble there /?I mean there \\'s been a lot of discussions about the authorities getting uh annoyed about you knocking on doors and things like that /.Well it \\'s not that /.Um there was some /.the Aruban authorities /-and we \\'ve had conversations about this /.This is squared away /.It \\'s been straightened out /.Um there was uh some evidence that leaked out to the fact that had an arrest warrant for my arrest on Wednesday and that I was working without a work permit and I was going to be deported by {law enforcement} [313] and Wednesday night {the law enforcement} [313] was looking for me to arrest me /.Uh all that is untrue /.and I want to make that perfectly clear /.Uh this was brought up by another media station here on the island that uh made claim to that /.but I can to assure /.Alright {/.It} [314] \\'s not true /.We \\'ll move on /.Alright /.Yes /.Alright /.Um uh {Harold} [315] finally this landfill /.Uh are you hopeful uh that {EquuSearch} [279] is going to find something /?How credible do you think that {witness} [316] is who says that {he} [316] saw three men dumping what looked like a blonde body /?Well uh as a retired FBI agent I \\'m always hopeful for an outcome /.Uh we interviewed the individual at length /.and having experienced hundreds if not thousands of interviews during my thirty - one years uh {this guy} [270] was very uh online /.He did n\\'t go mm ah /.I mean {he} [270] was like telling a story /.and it

line do you think that you \\'re going to be able to crack the case in the next uh couple weeks /?Well it depends /.I believe that law enforcement uh since {the FBI} [266] \\'s been here has been working very credibly /.Mhm /.And uh I believe that they have something um that \\'s probably solid enough and hopeful uh come September fourth that Joran Van Sloot will stay where he \\'s positioned

trial again especially in {California} [356] somebody needs to say look we are drawing the line /.You \\'re not going to get books at the end of the rainbow and do things inappropriate /.If {it} [357] pans out {it} [357] \\'s true I think Tom Sneddon himself should prosecute without respect to whether it would have been pro or anti {Michael Jackson} [319] /.So {Susan} [358] let \\'s assume for a minute it \\'s true /.Again you \\'re the prosecutor /.and you \\'re sitting there going are you kidding me /?There were two or three jurors who wanted to convict /.and {they} [359] caved because {they} [359] were pressured or whatever /.You ca n\\'t do anything , can you /?Nothing /.eh game over /.You ca n\\'t take an appeal from an aquittal /.The problem that I have with this is as members

do anything about this , right /?I mean if {the jurors} [362] were tampering with evidence , if {they} [362] were playing with evidence et cetera back there {the prosecutors} [361] have to just suck

{Dan} [354] I believe {them} [362] /.You know {jurors} [364] are people /.We expect {them} [364] to be perfect little robots doing what the judge says /.and {they} [364] do n\\'t /.They \\'re going to watch television /.I \\'m sure {they all} [365] watch your show /.and {they} [365] watched {Susan} [358] try to convict {Michael Jackson} [319] /.but then I hope {they} [365] listened to me and to reason /.But the bottom line is {they} [365] reached a fair and just verdict /.You have to trust people and nail those attempts to control and hypercontrol this case /.Just backfired /.It made {the jurors} [362] feel isolated /.and now {they} [362] \\'re all quiet /.They wo n\\'t talk to us about what really went on /.Okay here \\'s my problem /.It \\'s {this woman} [366] saying {she} [366] was forced and bullied right into reaching the verdict that {she} [366] did {/.and} [367] there {she} [366] is saying I did n\\'t like the way that {this woman} [366] snapped at me talking about the accuser \\'s mother et cetera /. /.You know {Dan} [354] I do n\\'t even talk to juries afterwards unless I win because you \\'re always going to hear things like that /.People in a jury room are in a

/.eh hey hey if I may say /-But {Dan} [354] your point is that /-You know a bar room brawl is one thing /.They were acting like outlaws if these allegations are true /.Right /.And you know I agree {Susan} [358] that {the prosecutors} [361] ca n\\'t do anything to {Michael Jackson} [319] /.but {they} [361] certainly can do something to the jurors {/.and} [367] I think it is more important right now to say /-I \\'m telling you {Dan} [354] you and I have covered a lot of trials in {this city /.and} [367] we \\'ve seen a lot of weird things happen since OJ Simpson with books and everything else

that {the wife} [387] is not a suspect and that they are focusing in on these two Russian brothers as you said who live in {Brooklyn} [382] /.The {California} [356] teen is apparently the key to {the case} [388] at this point /.That \\'s law enforcement \\'s focus /.If this young man will talk this could break open what happened to George /.The key question is is this a tragic accident or is this foul play /?Right now law enforcement seems to think it \\'s foul play /.US attorney Kevin O\\'Connor said we have reason to believe there could have been foul play here /.Um alright uh Mister Zalisko do you know anything from your personal experience of having been on {the cruise} [390] as to what happened /?Uh good evening sir /.Uh first I \\'d just like to clarify I \\'m a police chief in Oak Hill Florida not {Orlando} [389] /.Uh now as far as {the cruise} [390] uh I was on {the cruise} [390] that uh uh day /.and the way I became aware of what occured was that uh the morning of the fifth {a relative of mine} [391] had mentioned that there was blood stain on the canopy beneath {her} [391] uh balcony /.at {that point} [392] {we} [393] kind of dismissed {it} [392] /.We did n\\'t know what was uh going on /.Uh {we} [393] then went on {our} [393] daily excursion /.However later on into {the cruise} [390] that day uh {the ship} [381] \\'s captain went onto {the PA system} [394] and made an announcement that uh {authorities} [395] were on {the ship} [381] and {they} [395] were investigating the possibility that an individual had gone overboard during the night or early morning hours /.When I asked {my cousin} [396] {the uh size of the blood splatter} [397] {she} [396] had indicated {it} [397] was relatively the size of a small uh dog of a beagle type /.However viewing those photographs on TV that blood splatter is much larger than uh a small dog /.Mhm /.In fact it \\'s maybe three to four feet in length /.And then we \\'ve been hearing many stories that uh there were a lot of people going into and out of the state rooms uh which would indicate that the crime scene was not properly secured in the early stages of the investigation /.Well /.Alright let me play this piece of sound from one of the passengers who was uh staying right nearby uh this particular uh room /.We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin /.Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing /.And {he} [398] says uh later um chief that {he} [398] heard a horrific thud /.Well yeah that would indicate that something did go on there /.and we know uh that {the three individuals} [399] were in a room uh with {Mister Smith} [380] /.And the question that has to be uh presented to everybody is why is it taking so long for authorities to interview the individual that was in a cabin next door /?Mhm /.Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after {the crime} [400] /.Yeah /.Yeah /.And you would not just interview that individual next door /.You would have to take a step to interview people above below and to both sides /.Susan what \\'s the answer to that /?But Dan /.there are jurisdictional problems here /.You know it \\'s not a clear cut case as to who gets to prosecute {this case} [401] /.Turkey ca n\\'t do anything without a body /.United States can /.Fair play of the United States for stepping in /.fair play to law enforcement for getting involved /.Jurisdiction is n\\'t clear /.but they \\'re working very hard to solve {the crime} [400] /.I do n\\'t think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in {this case} [401] /.Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got {their} [402] investigators and {their} [402] lawyers in from what I understand right away to make this go away /.so I think {law enforcement} [403] was put in a bad position trying to play catchup {/.and} [373] I think {they} [403] \\'re doing +an amazing job /.Larry so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence /?Well it \\'s very difficult {Dan} [354] {/.Uh} [404] obviously as {we} [405] keep saying {we} [405] do not have a body /.therefore {we} [405] do not have a cause or a manner of the death /.But {we} [405] do have some physical evidence /.Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me it was not done the proper way /.It was n\\'t a forensic photograph /.So I really do not know how large {the stain} [406] was in {its} [406] dimensions /.but it is pretty clear that there \\'s a lot of blood there great deal of blood /.It makes you think that something criminal occured /.But again getting back to how you solve the crime you got to go to the crime scene /.and I think there are multiple scenes here /.Every place there \\'s blood it \\'s a crime scene /.But the most important place is the cabin because that \\'s presumably where the injury took place /.Now there was some rumor about some arguments going casino the night before {/.Uh} [404] and it could very well be that {he} [404] was arguing with {these individuals} [399] /.so uh that could be the tie the connection /.and I think good policework would connect {the individuals} [399] in question with the casino with {Mister Smith /.and} [373]{Mister Smith} [380] /.and that might help {us} [407] understand what happened /.this is um a little bit more sound /.This is again from {Cletus Hyman} [408] uh who was literally um in a joining or nearby cabin um as to what {he} [409] heard around {he} [409] said four in the morning the day before uh {Mister Smith} [380] went missing /.At times it sounded like furniture was being actually picked up and dropped {/.and} [373] then that horrific uh thud /.Yeah I mean that sure sounds to {me} [408] chief like {we} [407] \\'re not talking about someone who /-I mean I guess it \\'s possible if you \\'re talking about loud yelling coming /-Well look if this guy \\'s right that loud yelling is coming from the cabin right and {the wife} [387] is not a real suspect here means that there was probably someone else in there /.Well there absolutely was someone else in that room /.And what \\'s interesting is there was a witness who uh had informed {ship} [410] \\'s authorities that {she} [387] had heard a scream uh early that morning /.And what \\'s really interesting is uh {we} [407] do n\\'t know if {she} [387] \\'s been interviewed at this point /.But it was five days later that {the ship} [410] \\'s attorneys had begun to question {her} [387] not law enforcement but ship \\'s attorneys /.We will uh continue to follow this /.Chief Zalisko of the Oakhill Police Department

[431] /.Alright Erin let me start with you /.What do you think {the biggest problem} [432] is out there when {it} [432] comes to {these sex offenders} [433] /?Well I think that there \\'s a gross misconception about sex offender crimes /.I think most do not realize how pervasive the problem is /.The sex offenders that we have caught are a very small percentage of those that are out there /.Statistically one in four girls and as many as one in six to ten boys are sexually assaulted before they are eighteen /.That \\'s nationwide /.This problem is much bigger than I think people are realizing /.And {Linda} [429] I guess what {we} [434] \\'re realizing as {we} [434] have been highlighting {these wanted sex offenders} [433] around {the country} [435] is how many of {them} [433] are still out there and wanted /.Well currently there \\'s um right now uh over a hundred thousand that are missing /.Unbelievable /.Uh we know that there \\'s over five hundred thousand registered /.So

{he} [467] said that Ye Ting should not be called Marshal Ye Ting but rather General Ye Ting .Right , right , right , General Ye Ting .Why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?Um , {he} [467] died in \\'46 .That marshal , afterward , after Liberation , um , it was conferred on {him} [467] , so only then --OK , {we} [477] \\'ll call {him} [467] General Ye Ting .Mm .Because ,Very naughty ?To what extent were you naughty then ?In fact I was a very well - behaved child .But I was , forced into {it} [478] , , if you were n\\'t naughty there was no way to survive .What do you mean forced into {it} [478] ?During {the Cultural Revolution} [475] , , um , {my family} [468] was considered capitalist roaders .So {the kids} [479] then did n\\'t want to play with you , or {they} [479] would tease you , {that sort of thing} [480] .Mm .So you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,Why was that ?Was it because people for example would say that {your father} [481] was such and such , or {your family} [468] was such and such .Right .So it was because of {that sort of thing} [480] ?Right , the majority of it was like that .Mm .Mm .Because you had to face them alone , OK , {a dozen people who wanted to fight you .You} [482] had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough .So {that} [483] was , the only way you could overcome {them} [482] and get the upper hand .Mm .Were you tough ?Mm .Very tough .Tough enough to --Because , there was no way , if you were n\\'t tough that was it , , how could you manage .You were the son of capitalist roaders , , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it \\'s perfectly normal .Mm ., I remember one time , we were digging out {an air - raid shelter , that --Those , good kids} [484] , {they} [484] went there and threw stones .I did n\\'t dare defend {myself} [483] , so I just had to endure it for quite a while .Mm .Finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on {the head} [485] , And I got angry , so angry that I rushed out with {a shovel} [486] and hit {them} [486] with {the shovel} [486] .Where did {the shovel} [486] come from ?From digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right .Mm .So you picked up {the shovel} [486] and rushed {them} [486] .Did you crack somebody \\'s head open ?Mm , anyhow , yes , I cracked {their head} [485]{their} [486] head open , it was very tragic .All of a sudden nobody was making a sound .Very --Once I fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me .How many of {them} [487] did you take out ?I hit one of {them} [487] and that was enough .Nopbody went to get {the schoolmaster or somebody \\'s father} [488] ?{They} [488] did , and there was a huge fuss .Mm .Because when I was little , having a big fight like that .Mm .Anyhow , more or less , , on average , every two years I changed school , and that \\'s how it had to be .Mm .I remember one time -- Mm , also , when I was in fifth or sixth grade , {someone} [489] yelled out , Down with {Ye Zhengming} [476] , {he} [489] was yelling at {me} [489] , and I had to fight them .Mm .After the fight I went home , and {my father} [481] was standing far away ., the factory , , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters Down with {Ye Zhengming} [476] , , the slogan .Mm .I got accustomed to {it} [490] while passing by at that time , and now when I think about {it} [490] , it seems very much like a stage play .Mm .Back then I felt , looking at {him} [481] standing so far away --I walked over to {him} [481] , and {he} [481] said , um , you really do n\\'t understand anything .At the time I felt like I had a grievance .And I felt , I was fighting for you , {the people} [491] were cursing you , and I was fighting {them} [491] .In fact that \\'s the way kids think .Mm .You think , you bastard .What you say does n\\'t count .you come after {me} [489] and I \\'ll take you down .You come down , and I \\'ll take you down .If you have balls , you come on down .Come on down .Come down .Come down , come on , fight , fight , fight .I say you take a whack .Whack .I \\'m telling you , if you kill somebody you \\'ll pay with your life , do you understand ?, You \\'ve already handed {him} [481] over .I sent someone .OK , OK , I sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at {me} [489] .Come on , take a whack at {me} [489] .Take a whack at {me} [489] .Your dad knows who broke the window .Take a whack .Take a whack .Take a whack .Are n\\'t you willing to be friends with us ?Yes , I am {.He} [492] says {he} [492] \\'s willing .Did you hear ?{He} [492] says {he} [492] \\'s willing .Ok , that \\'s all right , let \\'s go play .This is a movie directed by Ye , called There \\'s a Place Called Wangjiazhan .Wangjiazhuang , right .This is obviously {him} [492] as a boy , uh , a memory of {his} [492] childhood life .Right .Right .Which {child} [493] is you .Is this child you , or is that child you ?Actually {we} [494] should be accurate ; {this child} [493] \\'s experiences ,So this child ,Um , right , right , right , because once , IMy father was denounced , and then the rebels took {us} [494] , took {that child} [493] to see .Mm .They denounced {my father} [481] , so I was very indignant ,{They} [495] let a lot of people expose my father ,Mm .Then the day after I took a kitchen knife and ran over to {their} [495] home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that I \\'d hack the guy up .A kitchen knife ; a knife from your kitchen at home .Oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .Then I was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n\\'t just hack people up .But I had already said it .What did you say ?said I have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like {this child} [493] .But , {those adults standing around} [496] reasoned with {me} [497] , said look , you do n\\'t understand {this} [498] .If you do {this} [498] , you \\'ll stir up more trouble , and then wo n\\'t your dad be even worse off ?In fact when {they} [496] said that , my mind had already eased .I could not lose the face this way , , So then I ran over and took a whack at {the door} [499] , to get an excuse for {myself} [497] .Was it all ruined ? {The door} [499] --I slashed {it} [499] twice .Um , was n\\'t there any consequence ?Mm , there was no consequence , , I just let the adults reason with {me} [497] .Mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .It , had a great influence on {me} [497] .Including that village , that environment , it \\'s all very familiar to you .More or less , very close to {me} [497] , this is a novel of .Mm {.Mm} [500] ., the reason I like {it} [501] is because , um , {it} [501] brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories .Mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in {Beijing} [469] .What year was it that you moved to {Shanghai} [502] ?How old were you at that time ?, In \\'69 I was 11 years old .Mm .Mm , well .In \\'69 at the age of 11 you went from {Beijing} [469] to {Shanghai} [502] .Mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n\\'t completely passed .Mm , {as} [503] {he} [503] puts {it} [503] , looking at {it} [503] now , {some of the memories} [504]{the memories} [470] can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .I went there every day and then {they} [504] suspended classes , , so I could n\\'t go to school , could n\\'t go to class .Mm .So , later I remember there was -- {Mm} [505] . A guy in {the engineering team} [506] , and {he} [507] brought {Quotations} [508] from {Chairman Mao} [509] and said to me , {He} [507] said , now take this , now take {these Quotations} [508] from {Chairman Mao} [509] and teach yourselves , and in the future you \\'ll take up arms and teach yourselves .A {lot of people} [510] were very happy , very excited , because {they} [510] were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?Right , but the problem --Because , I had never studied well ,In 1966 {the Great Cultural Revolution} [475] came , and at that time {Ye Daying} [467]{Ye Daying \\'s} [467] family moved from {Beijing} [469] to {Shanghai} [502] to live .His {father Ye Zhengming} [476] was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .And the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of {Ye Daying} [467]{Ye Daying \\'s} [467] life .He was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .When you got to {Shanghai} [502] the environment changed ; did n\\'t your whole person change ?After I got to {Shanghai} [502] , , settling into , , that ,All that time , from \\'69 to \\'76 , I graduated from {senior middle school} [511] , it all took place there .Mm .At that time in school , there were some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in {that class} [512] ?Right , right , , see , like study classes to educate good kids .What kind of people were in {your class} [512] ?Um .Anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say {they} [513] were little hooligans , {they} [513] were all mixed in together in {that class} [512] , and there were also some who had problems at home .Mm .All of {them} [513] , and every day I went there , and {the classes} [514] were suspended , , so {they} [514] did n\\'t let me go to school , did n\\'t let me go to class .Mm .So , afterward , I remember there was {Mm} [515] . A guy in {the engineering team} [506] , and {he} [516] brought Quotations from {Chairman Mao} [509] and said to me , {He} [516] said , now take this , now take {these Quotations} [508] from {Chairman Mao} [509] and teach yourselves , and in the future you \\'ll take up arms and teach yourselves .Lots of fun .Mm .So I was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .In fact it was n\\'t that {we} [517] did n\\'t study , I think it was ,{This class} [512] really helped me a lot , , sometimes in my life I think about this ,Mm .That period was {both} [518] a happy and a fun time .Because I was a good egg .In this I go against the grain .Um , the thing is , , {they} [518] \\'re all the same .If you \\'re bad , you do what you want , and so , you \\'re honest and so it \\'s easy to be free .Plus when you yourself have already decided that you \\'re a bad kid , then , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you \\'re completely liberated and free .I think that --Um , of course today {we} [517] say , at that time , um , in that class of {ours} [517] , they were n\\'t all necessarily bad kids .Mm .They just were n\\'t like normal kids ., it was like a brotherhood .Ah , and {we} [517] did some things that were out of bounds .Mm , {we} [517] helped each other .Very sincere , very sincere and good .When {he} [519] was in {that class} [512] , {Ye Daying} [520] received patient teaching every day .At that time {he} [519] encountered the first love of {his} [519] life that still remains fresh in {his} [519] memory .This girl became the only light in {Ye Daying \\'s} [467]{Ye Daying} [520] \\'s dark life for several years .In those days if {a middle school student} [521] liked a fellow - student , how did {he} [521] go about expressing that ?Um .When I was a school kid , for example , Um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , I liked {her} [522] .Mm .I always felt , um , {she} [522] can , give you more on {your plate} [523] , put more things on {your plate} [523] for you to eat .And then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together .Mm .It was ,So already you could -- Go see {a movie} [524] ; I thought ,That was it , that was it .You just want to go see {the movie} [524] , you do n\\'t worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , --So you went to {the movies with this girl} [525]{this girl} [522] ?Yes .Do you still remember {what movies} [525] you saw ?{The Flower Girl} [522] .I still remember that now .Mm .She cried as hard as {she} [522] could .So seeing {The Flower Girl} [522] was the equivalent of seeing Titanic now .Oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .Yes , crying {her} [522]{her eyes} [526] out , a big film like that .At the time I thought I would n\\'t cry .But the people all around were crying , and I thought {if} [527] I did n\\'t cry {it} [527] would look bad .So then you cried .So then I thought , I should let my emotions go .Um , how was {the girl} [522] , was {she} [522] very pretty ?, now I remember that {she} [522] was very pretty , mm {.Mm} [500] .She was a very good student .Ha ha , this --How was it {she} [522] liked you ?At that time {we} [528] did n\\'t talk about it , if two people gave each other {the eye} [529] and felt {it} [529] was right , then ,Gave each other {the eye} [529] , while you were in the class you gave each other {the eye} [529] ., so , when {we} [528] were in class , for example you ,I remember how it happened , yes .Um . When {we} [528] went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .Mm .Mm .So then , {we} [528] \\'d each pick up a piece of {chalk} [530] and toss {the chalk} [530] back and forth . And throw spitballs .I threw {it} [530] at someone else but missed , and {it} [530] hit {her} [522] .The result was that {she} [522] turned {her} [522] head to look .And {she} [522] looked at you angrily .I thought , uh-oh , the expression in {her} [522]{her eyes} [526] was like {she} [522] would forgive you , that kind of feeling .I thought wow , it \\'s so wonderful , that kind of feeling .Mm .That \\'s how it was , I should say .It was like that ?Mm .Many years later , afterward , we graduated from {senior middle school} [511] , and I was still going to see {her} [522] .Mm .The --, so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .You graduated from middle school in \\'73 .\\'74 .Mm .Graduated from midle school in \\'74 .Mm , that female schoolmate went to the {Shanghai} [502] suburbs to live and work .Right , right , yes .Ye {Daying} [520] went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were , forty - some yuan ?{Mm} [505] , when I started {it} [531] was a technical school .Then at first {it} [531] was 13 yuan , the first year 13 yuan ; the second year {it} [531] was 15 yuan , and the third year {it} [531] was 41 yuan .Mm .Mm {.41 yuan} [532] , at the time , for {him} [532] , it was , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money .It was a lot of money .In 1976 , there were two happy events in {the Ye family} [533] .The first was that {his} [534] father , Ye Zhengming , was released and reunited with {his family} [533]{his} [534] family that {he} [534] had been separated from for three years .The second event was that {Ye Daying} [520] had {his} [520] 18th birthday and became an adult .With the turn for the better in {his} [520] father \\'s political circumstances , {Ye Daying} [520] left behind {his} [520] violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking .In 1978 the big news was that {the college entrance exams} [535] would be reinstated nationwide , and people of {Ye Daying} [520]{Ye Daying \\'s} [520] age were thrilled .However , at this time {Ye Daying} [520] , facing this opportunity that would change {his} [520] fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .You thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?Oh my , in fact , \\'78 , for {me} [536] , was an especially depressing time .Mm .Mm .Up to then , um , I had never thought about the future .Mm .I thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -LRB- factory -RRB- worker .In society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead .Um , in {\\'78} [537] suddenly they reinstated {the college entrance exams} [535] .At that time , in {\\'78} [537] , I was 20 .A {lot of people} [538] were happy , very excited , because {they} [538] reinstated {the college entrance exams} [535] ; why were you feeling depressed ?Right , but the problem was , , Because , I had never done well in school .So right off I felt that I was finished , {--Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school} [539] , , compared to {me} [536] , {they} [539] had a future , um , {they} [539] could stand out .Mm .So I was hopeless , right off I was feeling down .Very clearly a --If you wanted to take {the exams} [535] , what kind of score did you think you \\'d get .I did n\\'t take {the exams} [535] , I did n\\'t have the nerve , I did n\\'t try , so --, the extraordinary thing was , at that time {my mom} [540] was attending {the film institute} [541] , {she} [540] was an instructor there .Mm .Mm , I had n\\'t thought , , that I would work in the movie .Mm ., um , {she} [540] wanted to send the recruitment announcement to {a friend \\'s house} [542] .Mm .So then I --One day {she} [540] sent me to deliver {it} [542] , and so I picked {it} [542] up and read {it} [542] , and once I read {it} [542] , oh ! The directing department of {the film institute} [541] , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and I thought wow ! This is just the ticket .Let \\'s run off to try and see .I thought you \\'ve loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , I want to be a director .No , I did n\\'t , no .It was just because there was no English exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .Right , it was very simple .Mm .One more thing , because in \\'78 , {the Beijing Film Institute} [543] was recruiting students in {Shanghai} [502] --Right .So , {Ye Daying} [520] went to take {the exams for the film institute} [544]{the film institute} [541] , but did n\\'t pass {the exams} [544] .His mother , An Qi , had never thought that {Ye Daying} [520] would sign up to take {the exam} [545] for {her} [520] work unit , {the Beijing Film Institute} [543] .But {Ye Daying} [520] in fact failed when {he} [520] took {the reinstated exam} [545] .Although it was the first time {he} [520] had taken {the exam} [545] , {it} [545] left {Ye Daying} [520] even more convinced that movies were something {he} [520] could do .The next year , 21 - year - old Ye Daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at {the Xi\\'an Film Studio} [546] .Being {an actor} [547] was not {his} [547] goal ; {he} [547] hoped rather to get into the directing profession .At that time you especially admired directors , right ?{Mm} [515] , because after I got to {the Xi\\'an Film Studio} [546] , um , I discovered I had {the shakes} [548] when I got on stage .Mm .Mm . Now , here chatting with you , I feel , um , it does n\\'t matter .Even today , in front of the lens , I \\'m a nervous wreck .Mm , very tense .Did you act then ?Of course , every day we had to , um , it was n\\'t just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that .I thought , this is definitely not working .Just getting on stage gave you {the shakes} [548] .Then , , no , it was n\\'t my thing , this , I could n\\'t find out why , and besides in those days ,Um , it was in \\'80 that I went to the Xi\\'an Film Studio ,Mm .At that time , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing .And I \\'m not that kind of person , so I could n\\'t get my bearings .So then at the same time when I saw that {Teng Wenji} [549] , {he} [549] was probably thirty - some years old , {he} [549] was the previous generation to us , very stubborn .Mm .Mm .That projecting force of {his} [549] , I thought wow , , that \\'s really good .He could really project .Because ultimately , there , I gradually realized this .Mm .And I would be in the audience and see {him} [549] directing on site .Mm .Mm , I could see how they worked .In fact in the beginning the attraction to movies was all these things , I thought it was really a bunch of fluff , I thought , that \\'s really fun , that \\'s really interesting .I thought who was stubborn , then I wanted to be that kind of person , but that did n\\'t mean I knew anything about that profession .So no one ever came looking for you to do a play ?At that time --Mm , no one ever came looking -- .They looked , but it was always just for an extra ., you did n\\'t even have any lines .Mm .That Xi\\'an Incident thing , I played an extra once .There was a guy playing Zhang Xueliang , and I played {his} [550] secretary going in to report to {him} [550] , and I did it a few times but I was always in the wrong place .What were your lines supposed to be ?It was \" reporting , a telegram \" that sort of thing .So you --So I had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful .So after I gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing .So the old director , Cheng Yin , um ,Mm .He would say , this is {An Qi \\'s son} [551] , why is {he} [551] like that ?Do you remember how many takes you did ?Oh , a lot .I think it was something like ten plus times .It was too , I \\'d walk badly and turn like that ., I attended {that class} [512] for half a year , um , um and then I got sick .Um , I got , , an inflammation of {the central nervous system} [552] , so {my whole body} [553] was paralyzed .Your {whole body} [553] was paralyzed ?Right .Your {whole body} [553] was paralyzed ?Right . I was paralyzed for ten months .So you could n\\'t move at all .I could n\\'t move at all .When {it} [553] started , my leg went numb , then {my hand} [554] went numb , and then {it} [554] started cross over , like that , and then slowly , slowly , slowly I could n\\'t move .What \\'s the scientific name of {the disease} [555] ?{It} [555] \\'s called Guillain - Barre Syndrome .It \\'s named after a foreigner .Mm .Ahem , if naming {it} [555] somewhat common , it \\'s , a paralysis of {the central nervous system} [552] , um , {it} [555] goes from the nerve endings to the flesh , and , then {it} [555] turns into myasthenia .And how did you get better , later ?Hormones .You took hormones .Um , , every day I had a transfusion .Mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat .Mm .Very fat .I \\'m so fat now , but compared to then it \\'s much better , in fact .At that time how fat were you ?Yah .Getting so fat , it was this , if I looked down I could see {my own cheeks} [556] , so I thought I was really fat .What do you mean ?{If} [557] I just look down , {my cheeks} [556] are right here .But after {they} [557] finished with the hormones , I gradually got better .Mm .The flesh all atrophied , um .If you look at when I was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --Later , based on that , it all evaporated .I \\'ve heard it said that that Wang Shuo novel , which we later saw as a television play --Sometimes , oh , right .Mm .Get some fun .Get some fun .The language in that , the part {Wang Zhiwen} [558] played , the disease {he} [558] got is about the same as your disease , is n\\'t it ?Right , right , right , right .So sometimes , oh , it was me and {Wang Shuo} [559] , together , it was , um , in \\'89 .Mm , together , um , wrote a -- .Aye , the script I wanted , the novel {he} [558] wrote , um , that piece {we} [560] created together .Mm {.Therefore} [561] , at {that time} [562] , {we} [560] were talking and talking to shoot , an urban love story , tell a love story , so {he} [561] took me , at {that time} [562] , , more or less that story , as background .Mm .Then after I went back to Beijning , when {we} [560] made arrangement and were eating together , I saw {Wang Shuo} [559] for the first timeThen , when I saw {him} [559] for the first time , {Wang Shuo} [559] was holding a book in {his} [559] arms , a book , that was Floating on the Sea , that novel {he} [559] wrote , {it} [563] was a sample .Mm .Gave {it} [563] to {me} [559] , and I took {it} [563] back to school to read .I read {it} [563] and wow , that day , I thought {he} [559] would be able --Our generation could really find {ourselves} [564] , I mean --Um , in the end I knew {we} [564] --Why {we} [564] studied movies , um , and why wrote things , expressing one \\'s own kind of thing is the most accurate personYe {Daying} [520] had already read {Wang Shuo} [559]{Wang Shuo \\'s} [559] novel Love the Hard Way , and the story and the style it was written in made a profound impression on {him} [559] .He sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express .Later {he} [559] was introduced by a friend , and {Ye Daying} [520] met the author of the novel , {Wang Shuo} [559] , at {the film institute} [541] .That was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today .How many plays did you collaborate on ?Today , {U.S.} [565] Secretary of Defense William Cohen promised to catch and punish those responsible for {the bombing of the `` Cole \\'\\'} [566]{the `` Cole \\'\\'} [567] and defended the Navy \\'s decision to refuel ships in {Yemen} [568] as {investigators} [569] continued {their} [569] day at work .Morton {Dean} [570] reports it \\'s a difficult day for the sailors remaining on board .The stressful , monumental task for the crew on the U.S. carrier suffered a setback .The ship began to take on water and lost electrical power again .A difficult time became even more difficult .It led to the cancellation of a memorial service planned for the 17 sailors who lost their lives .Details are becoming known about the damage , most obvious , the huge hole , but also the deck is buckled .Even the superstructure is damaged .Hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed .Rear Admiral Mark Fitzgerald , who visited {the Cole} [567] , was stunned by the damage .I wo n\\'t tell you whether {the ship} [567] is going to sink or not sink , but there was considerable damage to {the ship} [567] .According to {U.S.} [565] officials here {tonight} [571] , the most important questions about {the attack} [572] remain unanswered .Any details or speculation on who specifically , we do n\\'t know that at this point .With well over 100 {U.S.} [565] investigators now in {Yemen} [568] , the search for evidence is now fully under way .It \\'s been officially designated `` Operation Determined Response , \\'\\' and that suggests several things that {the U.S.} [565] , of course , is determined to discover who carried out {the bombing} [566] and that any group who helped plan {the attack} [572] faces a response from the U.S. military .The {U.S.} [565] believes there are anti-American terror groups based in {Yemen} [568] .Half the population lives in settlements with 500 people or less , and senior {U.S.} [565] officials here say {the government} [568] , although friendly to {the United States} [573] , does not have full control over {the entire country} [568] {.Yemen \\'s President} [574] has repeatedly said an internal explosion rocked {the `` USS Cole} [575] , \\'\\' but tomorrow {U.S.} [565] officials expect {him} [574] to announce that {he} [574] has changed {his} [574] mind , and tomorrow , the search for bodies will resume .Ten {U.S.} [565] sailors are still missing .Morton {Dean} [570] , {Yemen} [568] .To learn more about {Yemen} [568] , go to our website at abcnews.com .The remains of four sailors killed in {the `` USS Cole \\'\\' bombing} [566] returned to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware today .They were the last of the dead to be flown home , but in {Yemen} [568] , the search for those responsible for {the bombing} [566] continues .Investigators turned up new evidence and more leads today .ABC \\'s {John Miller} [576] reports .Investigators have searched at least half a dozen homes around the port of {Aden} [577] including this one , trying to retrace the movements of what they believe may be six or more suspects .This {house on Al Zaharah Street} [578] half a mile from the port is where investigators believe {the bomb} [579] was built into the boat that carried {it} [579] .Just after {the men} [580] moved in , {neighbors} [581] say {they} [580] erected a metal corrugated wall to block {the neighbors \\'} [581] view of the yard .Investigators say {the men who lived here} [580] worked on {the boat} [582] behind these walls in the last few days of {their} [580] stay almost constantly .At first , {neighbors} [583] were curious , but later {they} [583] complained about the noise .On the day of {the bombing} [566] , neighbors saw {the boat} [582] leaving through these gates pulled by a Nissan 4 x 4 truck .The trip from {the house} [578] to the harbor was only about a mile , then six miles by water to the spot where the American destroyer was refueling .Today , {FBI agents and divers} [584] were collecting evidence near the place {they} [584] believe {the boat} [582] was lowered into the water just before {the attack on the `` USS Cole \\'\\' which killed 17 sailors and two suicide bombers .Investigators} [585]{the `` USS Cole \\'\\'} [586] which killed 17 sailors and {two suicide bombers} [587] .Investigators have come up with a series of names of possible suspects found on papers in the houses and cars {they} [585] searched .In {some cases} [588] , {they} [588] have some names .They have not been able to verify {whether} [589] {they} [589] \\'re accurate , true names .In {other cases} [590] , I do n\\'t believe {they} [590] have identities yet .Yemeni sources say some of {the bombers} [587] may have used ID cards issued by a government registration center 35 miles from {Aden} [577] .Today , at the walled - in headquarters of the government security agency , the manager of that center and several clerks who worked there were among dozens who have been detained and questioned .Investigators are aware that a few weeks before {the bombing} [566] , accused {terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden} [591] released a videotape calling for holy war against Americans in the Gulf .American {investigators} [592] also say the way {the bombers} [587] organized the plot in {Aden} [577] has stark similarities to the way {Bin Laden} [591]{Bin Laden \\'s} [591] cells have operated in the past , but , {they} [592] concede , while {they} [592] are closer to learning the names of {the bombers} [587] , {they} [592] are still a long way from knowing or proving who sent {them} [592] .John {Miller} [576] , {ABC News} [593] , {Aden} [577] .We have an exclusive report tonight about {the `` USS Cole} [575] , \\'\\' and an identical attack that was planned , but failed , several months earlier .Here \\'s {ABC} [594]{ABC \\'s John M Wethy .ABC} [595] {News} [593] has learned that the terrorists who attacked {the `` USS Cole \\'\\'} [586]{`` USS Cole \\'\\'} [567] originally planned to hit a different American warship in the same port ten months earlier .The attack was to be part of a worldwide effort during celebration of the millennium that included targets in Jordan and Seattle .Intelligence sources say the target was to be a destroyer , the `` USS The Sullivans , \\'\\' which refueled in {Yemen} [568] \\'s port of {Aden} [577] in January .Sources tell {ABC News} [593] that {a suspect who has been in custody for several weeks} [596] told Yemeni investigators that {his} [596]{his group} [597] failed in {their attack} [572]{their} [597] attack because {their} [597] small boat , overloaded with explosives , sank just off the beach .The {suspect} [596] said it took months to repackage and redesign the load of high explosives that was eventually used against `` the Cole . \\'\\'{John M Wethy} [595] , {ABC News} [593] , the Pentagon .Good evening .That call to order you just heard reverberates through {the Supreme Court} [598] every day that the justices convene , but today was no everyday session .Never before has {the United States Supreme Court} [598] taken up a case that could decide a presidential election .It did today .That session of {the Supreme Court} [598] and two defeats for {Al Gore} [599] in {Florida} [600] courts dominate the news today .We start with {the U.S. Supreme Court} [598] , specifically at issue , an appeal from {the campaign of George W. Bush} [601]{George W. Bush} [602] that {the Florida Supreme Court} [598] had exceeded {its} [598]{its authority} [603] when {it} [598] ruled {Florida} [600] counties could have more time to hand - count ballots .Throughout an hour and a half of argument , {the justices} [604] were aggressive in peppering lawyers with questions , and {they} [604] seemed interested on two issues .Was there a federal issue involved that would even require {the U.S. Supreme Court} [598] to rule ? and if so , did {the Florida Supreme Court} [598] improperly rewrite {Florida} [600] law , as {Governor Bush} [602] contends ?A sure sign of the historic nature of the day \\'s proceeding , for the first time ever , {the court} [598] immediately released an audiotape of the arguments .But in the courtroom , listening in person was {ABC} [594]{ABC \\'s Jackie Judd} [605] .Even now , hours after that hearing ended , there are still {protesters circling the Supreme Court} [606]{the Supreme Court} [598] .As boisterous as {the protesters} [606] were , {nothing intruded on the ritual inside .The chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States .The courtroom} [607]{the United States} [573] .The courtroom was packed .Al {Gore} [599] \\'s top campaign aides , {his} [599] children , Republican senators and congressmen , {they} [607] were all there .God save {the United States} [573] and {this honorable court} [598] .First up , {Ted Olson} [608] lawyer for {George W. Bush} [602] , laying out {the campaign} [601] \\'s main claim .Olson made it through only 56 seconds of {his} [608] arguments before a justice broke in .Well , Mr. Olson --Sandra Day O\\'Connor , often the swing vote on {this court} [598] , demanded to know why {the court} [598] even had a role in this case .Olson argued that a century - old federal statute prevents laws governing an election from being created after the fact which , {he} [608] claimed , is just what {the Florida court} [598]{Florida} [600] court did , and also , that {the U.S. Constitution} [609] gives state legislatures , not the courts , the right to choose electors .Of {all the justices} [604] it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg who seemed most sympathetic to {the Florida Supreme Court} [598] .Midway through the hearing , {Chief Justice Rehnquist} [610] seemed to scold {his} [610] colleagues for being too talkative when {he} [610] made an unusual offer to {the lawyer representing Florida \\'s Attorney General} [611]{Florida} [600] \\'s Attorney General .And so it went on .Laurence Tribe , {Gore} [599] \\'s attorney , said {the state court} [598] did nothing illegal .It simply provided a way for a close election to be examined .Justice O\\'Connor again , but this time suggesting {the state court} [598] had overstepped {its} [598]{its authority} [603] and perhaps there was a federal case here .Justice Antonin Scalia also pressed Tribe .He said {the state court} [598] relied on {the Florida Constitution} [609] to draft {its} [609] decision , excluding state lawmakers and that violated {the U.S. Constitution} [609] .It was Justice Breyer who asked the most straightforward question of all .What happens if {the court} [598] rules in favor of {Bush} [602] ?The answer from {the Secretary of State \\'s lawyer} [611] was , {Bush} [602] wins and all the litigation in {Florida} [600] ends .Not everyone agrees .They say that no matter which way {the court} [598] rules , {it} [598] will not provide nearly so much finality to {this presidential election} [612] .Charlie ?{Jackie Judd} [605] at {the Supreme Court} [598] .Our thanks .The {`` USS Cole \\'\\'} [567] has arrived back at the Mississippi shipyard where {she} [567] was built .ABC \\'s John M.

I had no idea I \\'d --We \\'re getting late word tonight that {Geraldo Rivera} [728] may not be be kicked {out of Iraq} [729]{Iraq} [730] after all .Originally {the Central Command} [731] said the veteran Fox News correspond was being expelled because {he} [728] compromised the location of {the unit} [732] {he} [728] \\'s been embedded with .Now a spokesman from {the Central Command} [731] is saying and I \\'m quoting `` Frankly , we have bigger and more important things to do . \\'\\'During a live broadcast {Geraldo} [728] drew a map in the sand showing the location of {the unit} [732] in relation to {Baghdad} [733] .Says {he} [728] \\'s not aware {he} [728] \\'s being expelled but says if so , it is because some bitter former colleagues of {his} [728] at {MSNBC} [734] blew the whistle on {him} [728] .It sounds to {me} [735] like {some rats at my former network , NBC} [736]{NBC} [737] , are spreading some lies about {me} [735] .You know , {they} [736] ca n\\'t compete fair and square on the battlefield so {they} [736] \\'re trying to stab me in the back .It is not first time .The {Central Command} [731] on the other hand says {Rivera} [728] is being kicked {out of Iraq} [729]{Iraq} [730] because `` {he} [728] gave away the big picture stuff . \\'\\'All of this now under review , whether or not {Geraldo} [728] stays or goes .We \\'ll continue to monitor that front on the store yix another veteran war correspondent is being fired for {his} [728] controversial conduct in {Iraq} [730] .NBC is terminating freelancer reporter {Peter Arnett} [738] for {statements he made to the Iraqi media} [739]{he} [728] made to the Iraqi media .We showed you {the statements} [739] yesterday {.He} [740] said the coalition \\'s first war plan had failed because of Iraqi resistance .Today {he} [740] appeared on {NBC} [737] \\'s `` Today \\'\\' show and said {he} [740] was sorry .I want to apologize to the American people for clearly making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving {an interview} [741] to Iraqi television .Now , I said in {that interview} [741] essentially what we all know about {the war} [742] , there have been delays in implementing policy , there has been surprises , but clearly by giving {that interview} [741] to Iraqi television , I created a firestorm in {the United States} [743] , and for that I am truly sorry .Arnett had been covering the war for National Geographic , which also fired {him} [740] as TV reports were given exclusively to {NBC} [737] and {MSNBC} [734] .Late word from London that the tabloid {the Daily Mirror} [744] just hired {Peter Arnett} [738] to be {its} [744] correspondent in {Baghdad} [733] .But {the question} [745] remains Did {Peter Arnett} [738]{Peter Arnett and Geraldo Rivera} [746]{Geraldo Rivera} [728] cross the line ? or were {they} [746] within {their} [746] rights as reporters ?{We} [747] posed that question to {Michael Wolf , a contributing editor for `` New York \\'\\' magazine ,

[747] tell you about this story , {we} [747] were going to , these are live pictures from {Baghdad} [733] .There \\'s been some activity in {the last few moments} [749] .Looks like tracer fire we \\'re looking at , {anti-aircraft guns} [750] firing at what {they} [750] sense is some sort of threat coming from the skies .Baghdad has had sporadic episodes of this {tonight} [717] .No major explosions {we} [747] \\'re aware of , but just , apparently , in {the last few moments} [749] , there has been activity .You can see it there just now .We \\'ve been reporting , {the city} [733] has begun to see {its} [733] electricity turned back on .We do n\\'t know that all of {it} [751] is back , but at least some of {it} [751] is .We also know that 12 miles southwest of {the city} [733] , coalition forces remain largely in control of what was formerly Saddam Hussein International Airport , now renamed by {the coalition Baghdad International Airport} [752] , but {the coalition} [752] is quick to point out that {they} [752] do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the airport .Again , {these} [752] are live pictures of {Baghdad} [733] , where it is well into the night .We \\'re , of course , going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn .Until southern Iraq , another symbol of {Saddam Hussein} [753]{Saddam Hussein \\'s}

was the lead story across {Connecticut} [783] in early April .Police say Jennifer O\\'Conner , a {Connecticut} [783] woman with a history of psychiatric problems confessed to shooting {her daughter} [784] 7 , while {the 7 - year - old girl} [785] lay sleeping .O\\'Conner told police {she} [785] could no longer cope with {her daughter} [784]{her} [785] daughter \\'s learning , disability Prps Sara Dade three days later .Thomas , owner a local {gun and motorcycle} [786] shop , said {he} [787] felt gutted when {he} [787] saw the news reports of {O\\'Conner} [788] \\'s arrest on murder charges .As soon as the police officers pulled {the gun} [786] out and held {it} [786] up , I knew {it} [786] was {my rifle} [789] .Reporter :Had sold {O\\'Conner} [788] {the rifle} [789] a few months before .She explained to me {she} [788] .Ed a lighter , smaller caliber hunting gun for deer hunting , for medium - size game hunting .Reporter :Followed the letter of law .He sent {O\\'Conner} [788] \\'s information to the state authorities for a background check .Once {she} [788] was cleared , he made {O\\'Conner} [788] wait for a minimum .Two weeks .He --From Texas politics now to Chinese censorship .China today blacked out a CNN interview that was critical of the Chinese government \\'s handling of the SARs epidemic and of {the country} [714] \\'s health care system .China requires {foreign broadcasters} [790] to use a Chinese satellite to serve {their country} [714]{their} [790] country .Until last month it was routinely blocking almost all reports about Sars in {China} [791] , a practice that has produced intense global criticism .The {British Broadcasting Company} [792] has also faced the censorship in {China} [791] .In 1993 {Rupert Murdoch} [793] bought a controlling stake in {China} [791] \\'s Star TV satellite system .In 1994 the BBC World Service broadcasts were pulled from Star .China was offended by {the BBC \\'s news content} [794] and demanded that {STAR TV} [795] remove {it} [794] or lose permission to broadcast in {China} [791] .A year later {Murdoch} [793] bought the rest of {Star TV} [795] that he did not own .Rupert {Murdoch} [793] \\'s News Corp. has an extensive presence , of course in {this country} [791] .That presence may be expanding soon , if {the FCC} [796] eases some of {its} [796] broadcast rules {.Murdoch} [797] has lobbied hard for those changes .They would allow {him} [797] to buy even more {U.S.} [761] television stations .Next month {the FCC} [796]{FCC} [796] is likely to accommodate {him} [797] .Murdoch today promised that if the rules are changed {he} [797] will limit future purchases to a few of what {he} [797] calls sizable markets .Let \\'s talk a little bit more about what {the Navy} [798] does to prevent such tragedies .We were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .I \\'ll try to explain it the best I can from what I remember from being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln \\'\\' .This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what {the Navy} [798] does with regard to prevention ., every sailor that \\'s entering {the Navy} [798] does take a swim test .They learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .Also drills take place before {sailors} [799] get on to any ship , before any deployment .Usually twice a day , {they} [799] \\'re practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed {a man} [800] overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , {those} [801] wane off , but {they} [801] know where to go quickly .They also wear float coats .You can see {them} [801] here .The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .Everything is color coordinated .You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and {they} [801] have toggles to pull and inflate .They also have {a manual device} [802] so if the toggles do n\\'t work {they} [801] can blow air into {the inflation device} [802] .They have dive goggles and {they} [801] \\'re able to find {them} [801] .It also has a strobe light and a whistle .Also such location devices , some ships have smoke floats they can toss out so {the man} [800] overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to , let the rescuer locate them .Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout {the ship} [779] , all around {the ship} [779] , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of {the ship} [779] , not all around {the entire ship} [779] , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .Now let \\'s talk about {the man overboard rescue} [800] and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .You will hear a P.A. announcement around {the entire ship} [779] , there is a man overboard so {everyone} [803] knows {they} [803] have to react quickly .A {ship - wide search} [804] will happen if {they} [804] do n\\'t see that person go overboard , but if indeed {they} [804] do see someone go overboard , {the ship} [779] starts to circle that area continuously .Also small boats sometimes go out into {the water} [805] , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .Inside {those helicopters rescue swimmers} [806] .If indeed {the man overboard} [800] is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .If {the man overboard} [800] is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely {those swimmers} [806] will go right into {the water} [805] and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull {them} [806] up into the helo and pull {them} [806] back on to {the ship for treatment} [807] and usually {a search} [808] takes about 24 hours .The search crews will go 24 hours before calling off {that search} [808] .Why call {it} [807] off ?There \\'s a number of reasons to look at .Depending on the water temperature , it \\'s very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is {they} [809] fail {they} [809] \\'ve exhausted all resources by that time .Anyway , we \\'ll continue to follow what \\'s happening on the `` USS Nassau \\'\\' as {those investigations} [810] continue for the two missing sailors .Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas scheduled to meet today , {their} [810] second chance now to discuss the {Bush} [811] administration \\'s road map for {Mideast} [812] peace .Both sides will meet with {President Bush} [811] when {he} [811] arrives in {the Mideast} [812]{Mideast} [812] next week .Our Jerusalem bureau chief Mike Hanna standing by with more and that .Mike ?In {the African nation of Nigeria} [813] , an Islamic court delayed the appeal of a woman condemned to death by stoning .The {court} [814] says {it} [814] will not hear this case until late August .The 31 - year - old mother of three was convicted in March of having sex outside of marriage .Three other Nigerians also face stoning deaths for the same crime .The prosecution of premarital or extramarital sex is not quite as rare as you might think .Our next guest this morning faced 100 lashes for premarital sex in Pakistan .She was there as a journalist in the wake of the 9 / 11 attacks .She has written about {her} [815] experience in the book `` Tantrika \\'\\' Traveling the Road of Divine Love .A traveling reporter now on leave and joins {us} [816] to tell {her} [815] story .Thank you for coming in to share this with {us} [816] .As I understand it , you say you were facing a sentence of 100 lashes , had not yet been sentenced that ?Back in this city , a courthouse in Manhattan .Sam Waksal , founder and {former CEO of ImClone} [817]{ImClone} [818] is scheduled to be sentenced today .He pleaded guilty earlier this year to insider trading , bank fraud and tax evasion .Waksal could be fined $ 3.5 million , facing a maximum of 75 years in prison , expected , though , to receive about six to seven years .That \\'s the early indication we \\'ve been given .A {friend of his , Martha Stewart} [819] , pleaded not guilty last week .The charges related to {her} [819] sale of {ImClone} [818] stock .She sold the share a day before bad news about {the company} [792] sent the stock price falling , considerably .Sam Waksal , sentenced , 10:00 a.m. , local time here in

.Freddie {Mac} [821] stock is down another 6.5 % today .It has lost more than 207 % -- or about 20 % since Monday .Monday , of course , is when {the company} [792] fired {its} [792]{its President} [811] for not cooperating with efforts to restate earnings for the last few years .Freddie {Mac} [821] \\'s Chairman and CEO forced out the same day .Investors learned last night {the CEO} [817] is getting a severance package worth $ 24 million .The {ousted President} [811] is going to walk away with more than $ 6 million in vested openings .Yesterday Federal Prosecutions announced a criminal probe into {the company} [792] .Probably tough number for the rest of the company employees to hear .I want to ask you a little bit about cell phones now .All of {us} [824] use {our} [824] phones , I think , maybe too much .The companies that {we} [824] pay for probably love it .Who talks more ?Men or --Off the coast there was a dramatic rescue by a cruise ship ship .Canada TV has the story and some dramatic pictures .Reporter :With winds bliping at more than 100 kilometers an hour , {three men} [825] desperately cling to {their} [825] sinking fishing boat .The crew sent out {a distress call} [826] after {it} [826] started taking on water .Suddenly {we} [824] realized {water} [827] came into {the engine room} [828] and {it} [828] was rising and {they} [829] started to pump , of course , and {they} [829] pumped and pumped and {the water} [827] came more and more and more .Reporter :{The ship} [779] was sinking by the second , and as the waves pounded against {them} [829] , waiting for help was {their} [829] only option .Their life raft had already been snitched away by {the high seas} [830] .When {we} [824] got {the information} [831] , {it} [831] was only 23 , 25 miles

windshield and leaving {him} [842] there to die .And Andrew Luster , grandson of cosmetic legend Max Factor , what drove {him} [842] to become a serial rapist and to jump bail in the middle of {the trial} [844] , only to be captured in {Mexico} [838] by a bounter hunter after five months on the Roun .That \\'s all next on `` {Larry King} [845] Live . \\'\\'We begin first with the extraordinary case of {Andrew Luster} [837] , and the guests are here in {Los Angeles} [839] , Roger John Diamond , {he} [845] is {Andrew Luster} [837]{Andrew Luster \\'s} [837] attorney , in Chicago , the well known {Bill Curtis} [846] .The special report will air tonight at 10:00 Eastern , A Twisted Mind , The Andrew Luster Story on A&E produced by CBS News Productions for A&E and {Bill Curtis} [846] is

{our} [848] coverage of presidential politics with a look at the last - minute battle to win a crucial swing state , Florida .25 electoral votes .It \\'s being fought over hard .With a look at how the candidates are getting out the vote there , here \\'s {NBC News} [849]{NBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders} [850] .The image of {Florida} [851] , both fact and fiction .A great getaway , a state where a mouse wields more power than a tropical paradise .While the mild winters make this comfortable living for almost three million seniors , the largest elderly population in {the United States} [852] , {this year} [853] {it} [853] is not the weather drawing {Al Gore} [854] and George W. Bush to the Sunshine State .Both candidates list 25 reasons to keep coming back , {Florida} [851] \\'s 25 electoral votes .Polls show {Florida} [851] is still up for grabs .Both {candidates} [855] have been here almost equally .In fact , it \\'s almost I dare you politics .Each of {them} [855] dares the other one to spend less time , money , and energy than {they} [855] are at {their} [855] own peril .Elderly voters once again in {Florida} [851]{Florida , the most important voting bloc} [856] because {they} [856] actually vote more than any other group .In {this election} [857] , 45 % of {those going to the voting booth} [858]{the voting booth} [859] are expected to be over the age of 65 .The issue most important to {them} [858] , {Social Security} [860] .Pay down {the nation} [813] \\'s debt , strengthen {Social Security} [860] , cut taxes for middle class family , save our environment .Experience .Vision .Values .Al {Gore} [854] .Why does {Al Gore} [854] say one thing when the truth is another ?{His} [854] attacks on {George Bush} [811]{George Bush \\'s} [811] {Social Security} [860] plan , exaggerations .The truth , nonpartisan analysis confirms {George Bush} [811]{George Bush \\'s} [811] plan sets aside $ 2.4 trillion to strengthen {Social Security} [860] .Both {candidates} [861] repeatedly talking about that one issue , but in {Florida} [851] where there are more than 550 children born every day , families drive the other campaign issues .Polls show education , the environment , and the candidate \\'s character will influence who voters choose .And in this diverse state with a 15 % Hispanic population , {both candidates} [861] courting {their} [861] votes in ways not seen in any previous election .Following {both conventions , Gore and Bush} [862]{Gore} [854] and {Bush} [811] granted {their} [862] first live TV interviews to this man .His name , Jorge Ramos , the Tom Brokaw of Spanish language news .The {race} [863] gets really , really close , and let {\\'s} [863] suppose that states like {Florida} [851] and Illinois might decide {the election} [857] .maybe , maybe Hispanic votes might decide , too , who would be the next President of {the United States} [852] .The largest Hispanic voting bloc of {Florida} [851] , Republican voters who do not seem to be crossing the party line .Gore wanted the young Cuban boy , Elian Gonzalez to stay in this country .Joe {Lieberman} [864] brings {Gore} [854] support {he} [864] probably would have gotten here anyway .Sizable Jewish and African - American voting blocs .Of {the 10 largest states} [852] , {Florida} [851] is the most Republican .The Republican governor here , {Jeb Bush} [811] was once expected to deliver {his} [811] brother this state .The managers of both campaigns saying in the end , the wipper may simply be determined by who gets more people to {the voting booth} [859] .Kerry {Sanders} [850] , {NBC News} [849] , Anaheim .There was , of course , a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over the weekend of {this trial} [844] going on in the courtroom in {Florida} [851] , and , of course , among the teams of lawyers on the {Bush} [811] side , one of the leaders , Ben Ginsberg , one of the lawyers who argued the case in Leon County Circuit Court .He \\'s with {us} [865] tonight , victorious in {Tallahassee} [866] , {Florida} [851] , and Ben , whatever the outcome today , and you were on the upside , you are forced now to go along with {the appeals process} [867] as is the right of {the Gore team} [868]{Gore} [854] team .What is your reaction to the work that will cause ?Well , I mean , {we} [865] \\'re certainly prepared to brief all the issues .I think that {the circuit court judge} [869] , Judge Sauls gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of {Florida} [851] law .Well , let \\'s talk about your statement earlier today that {the Vice President} [811] -- I guess you were asked should {the Vice President} [811] concede , and you answered , {the Vice President} [811] should do what \\'s best for {the United States} [852] .Is that what you \\'re trying to say ?Well , sure .I mean , I think that {all the people involved in this unique situation , the first time a presidential election in our history has been contested , Brian} [870]{Brian} [871] , need to do {the right thing} [872] , and I \\'m sure do {the right thing} [872] , as {they} [870] see fit .Do you think {the judge there} [869] , in addition to just giving out {his} [869] ruling at the end of the court session today , {he} [869] went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why {he} [869] turned down {the Gore case} [873]{Gore} [854] case .Do you think {his} [869] method there was to try to make this more or less appeal proof ?Well , I think what {he} [869] did was addressed the situation as it exists in {Florida} [851] and addressed the contingencies that were raised in the voluminous briefs that {he} [869] had , not only from the two party candidates involved , but also of the interveners who were in {the case} [873] .As you know , the Democratic line throughout is they wo n\\'t be happy until every vote is counted , and {we} [874] could n\\'t help but notice , should {we} [874] call it a rhetorical device you used when talking to reporters this afternoon .Pause and listen along with {us} [874] to the following piece of videotape .Those ballots have been counted not once on election night but twice in the recount and how many did you say there were ?10,750 --If you know the exact number , does n\\'t that mean {they} [875] \\'ve been counted ?So I do n\\'t suppose that was any accident on your part ?Well , {they} [875] have been making this point throughout these proceedings that {these ballots} [876] have never been counted , and that is factually not true .They have been counted on election night -- {they} [876] \\'ve been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not the case that {those ballots} [876] have failed to be counted by anyone .Ben , for better or worse , you are forced now to follow {the Gore team} [868]{Gore} [854] team as {they} [876] take you on a kind of trail of appeal here .If you were asked to predict whether this stops at the {Florida} [851] or U.S. Supreme Court , what would your prediction be ?I think it \\'s one of those situations where I would have predicted all , {Brian} [871] .I think that the decisions are not ours to make .We \\'ll be involved in all the legal processes obviously as long as {the Gore campaign} [877]{Gore} [854] campaign keeps {them} [877] up , no matter how long that takes .Ben Ginsberg , attorney for the {Bush} [811] team , victorious today in {Tallahassee} [866] .Thank you very much , after a long day , for being with us tonight .Thanks , {Brian} [871] .In the waters off the coast of {Yemen} [878] , two urgent missions tonight collecting evidence from {the suicide bombing} [879] and retrieving bodies still buried in debris .316 were aboard the {`` USS Cole \\'\\'} [880] when the terrorists struck .Dozens were injured .17 were killed .Our coverage begins with {NBC} [881]{NBC \\'s Joe Johns} [882] .A plane carrying the bodies of five dead American sailors from {the `` USS Cole \\'\\'} [883] arrived today at Dover Air Force Base , as the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the Department of Defense and {the FBI} [884] arrived in {Yemen} [878] .Their mission -- to continue the search for evidence and suspects in {the explosion} [879] .Also on the way , equipment to lift {the `` Cole \\'\\'} [883] out of the water and specialists to help retrieve the bodies of those trapped and presumed dead .We know there are {spaces that are inaccessible} [885] .We know there are some remains in {those spaces} [885] .We need to get in those and locate the remains that we anticipate finding there .Though the work was only beginning , a top {Justice Department} [886] official in {Washington} [887] predicted the outcome of {the investigation} [888] .I \\'m confident that we will be able to determine who was behind {the bombing} [879] and that {those people , those organizations} [889] , will be held accountable , {they} [889] will be punished .This critical phase of {the investigation} [888] must be conducted both above and beneath the water on a tight time line .They \\'ll want to get in there quickly because one of {the problems when you \\'re dealing with seawater} [890] is {that} [891] {it} [890] will have an adverse effect on your evidence .To further speed up {the process} [867] , {the FBI} [884] has now activated the Strategic Information and Operation Center in {Washington} [887] , conceived after the bombings of the {U.S.} [892] embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers .On the diplomatic front , {the U.S.} [892] said {the government of Yemen} [893]{Yemen} [878] is cooperating with {the investigation} [888] , though {that country} [878] \\'s President disputes charges that {his nation} [878]{his} [891] nation is a haven for terrorists .The {Justice Department} [886] says no group or individual has been ruled out as a suspect , though many expect that whoever gets the blame will eventually be tied to the terrorist Osama bin Laden .And the grieving continued today at the Naval Academy \\'s football game against Notre Dame .A moment of silence to remember the victims of this terrorist act .Joe {Johns} [882]{Johns , NBC News .The} [894]{NBC News} [849] .The {`` USS Cole \\'\\'} [880] is on {its} [894] long journey home tonight , sitting atop a rescue ship , and now , for the first time , {its} [894] open wound fully visible {.NBC \\'s Jim Miklaszewski} [895] tonight at the Pentagon with an exclusive report on the damage done and the difficulty in finding those responsible .Jim ?What \\'s the latest there ?New pictures reveal the sheer power of that terrorist bomb that ripped through the `` USS Cole . \\'\\'For the first time , with the `` {Cole} [896] \\'\\' out of {the water} [897] , the full impact of {the catastrophic blast} [898] clearly visible .In these photos obtained by {NBC News} [849] , the damage much larger than first imagined , extending well below the water line .Workers on deck dwarfed by the 40 x 60 - foot gaping wound .Large sections of the hull buckled inward .Crewman Sean Powell , back home in {Florida} [851] , says inside {the `` Cole} [899] , \\'\\' {it} [900] was chaos , {it} [900] got dark , we lost power , {ship} [899] started to list , that \\'s what scared everybody .Despite the devastating damage , Navy officials predict {the `` Cole \\'\\'} [883]{Cole} [896] \\'\\' can be repaired for about $ 150 million , and put back into service .Justice Department officials say in {Yemen} [878] , {the FBI} [884]{the FBI \\'s investigation} [888] is dead in {the water} [897] .Senior {U.S.} [892] officials tell {NBC News} [849] {the Yemen government} [893] has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind {the `` Cole \\'\\' attack} [901]{Cole} [896] \\'\\' attack .Evidence is either withheld or tampered with .A {surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the attack} [902]{the attack} [901] was so heavily edited , {it} [902] did n\\'t even show {the blast itself} [898] .Why ?{Yemen} [878] is a terrorist hotbed , and some members of President Saleh \\'s own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists .It \\'s hard to see exactly why it is that {the President there} [811] would ever want to cooperate with {the United States} [852] and possibly put {himself} [811] in jeopardy .Reporter :And even though cooperation from {Yemen} [878] is at a standstill , {U.S.} [892]{U.S. officials} [903] tell {NBC News} [849] that {they} [903] are making substantial progress in {the investigation} [888] and are fully confident {they} [903] will get enough evidence to retaliate against those responsible .Tom ?Thanks very much , {NBC} [881]{NBC \\'s Jim Miklaszewski} [895]{Jim Miklaszewski} [895] tonight .The nation \\'s highest court will take up {the case} [904] next week .That development may not be as significant as it seems .Joining me now is law professor Rick Pildes , a consultant to {NBC News} [849] .Could a decision from {the U.S. Supreme Court} [905] settle {this case} [904] once and for all ?At this stage , any decision from {the U.S. Supreme Court} [905] is almost certainly not going to provide a final resolution of {this election dispute} [906] .Indeed , the issue is so narrow now before {the Supreme Court} [905] that whichever way {the court} [905] rules , {it} [905] will likely have only the most marginal impact on what \\'s going on in {Florida} [851] .Even if {the Bush campaign} [877]{Bush} [811] campaign prevails before {the Supreme Court} [905] , {it} [877] simply means we will move more quickly into the contest phase of {the litigation} [907] or the next stage of {the litigation} [907] .But you believe the fact that {the U.S. Supreme Court} [905] just decided to hear {this case} [904] is a partial victory for both {Bush} [811] and {Gore} [854] .It is a partial victory for both sides .For the last two weeks , the central constitutional argument {the Bush campaign} [877]{Bush} [811] campaign has been making to the federal courts is , stop these manual recounts now , {they} [877] violate the Constitution .The {U.S. Supreme Court} [905] refused to hear that part of {the case} [904] , agreeing with all the other federal judges who have unanimously held that this is not the proper time for federal court intervention .So in that sense , a victory for {the Gore campaign} [877]{Gore} [854] campaign .For the {Bush} [811] campaign , a victory in the willingness of {the Supreme Court} [905] to play some role in overseeing the {Florida} [851] system and the {Florida} [851] judicial decision making process .Whatever {the Supreme Court} [905] decides this time , you say {this case} [904] could come back before {the U.S. Supreme Court} [905] again ?John , if {the Supreme Court} [905]{the Supreme Court of the United States} [905]{the United States} [852] is to play a final and decisive role in {this dispute} [906] , that role is going to come at the end of the {Florida} [851] judicial process , not at this stage .Law professor Rick Pildes , thank you .From {BBC News} [849]{BBC News in London} [908]{London} [909] , I am James Cawling for {The World} [910]{The World .The Yugoslav Army} [911] has given {its} [911] support to {President - elect Vojislav Kostunica} [912] .Earlier {he} [912] had an hour long meeting with {former President Slobodan Milosevic} [913] .It \\'s the first meeting since {Milosevic} [913] was ousted by a popular revolt .He conceded defeat and congratulated {his} [913] successor .Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says , the lifting of international sanctions against {Serbia} [914] can now be discussed .Our {sanctions regime} [915] is not against the people of {Serbia} [914] , {it} [915] was against {Milosevic} [913] , and if {Milosevic} [913] is gone then there are many ways that {the sanctions regime} [915] can be changed and lifted and adjusted .Albright says {Milosevic} [913] must not be allowed to maintain any position of power .Earlier {Russia} [916] also recognized {Kostunica} [912] as {Yugoslavia} [917] \\'s new leader .Visiting {Foreign Minister Evan Holf} [918] told {Milosevic} [913] {his} [918] time is up .This is {The World} [910] .I am Tony Kahn .Novelist and playwright {Gao Xingjian} [919] today became the first Chinese language author to win the Nobel Prize for Literature .Gao {Xingjian} [919] \\'s avant - garde plays made {him} [919] persona non-grata in {his} [919] native {China} [920] and {he} [919] fled {the country} [916] in 1988 .He settled in {France} [921] becoming a {French} [922] citizen two years ago .Gregory {Lee} [923] is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at {the University of Lyons} [924]{Lyons} [925] in {France} [921] .Professor {Lee} [923] , I gather you know {the man} [926] and know {his} [926] work .Tell us a little bit about him , Who is {he} [926] and why did {he} [926] flee {China} [920] .Gao {Xingjian} [919] is quite an interesting writer because in some senses {he} [919] differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in {the West} [927] today .I would say that the great difference about {Gao Xingjian} [919] is that {he} [919] actually received a university education .He was educated in {French} [922] , so has a very good knowledge of {French} [922] literature and it is very much {French} [922] literature that has influenced {his} [919] own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse {him} [919] of blind worship of Western models .Sartre is a big man in {Mr. Xingjian} [919] \\'s life , is n\\'t {he} [919] ?I would say so that Sartre has been a quite a big influence .I think the other influences would be Samuel Beckett , the Irish and French language writer , Unesco .These are models and , of course , all of these writers are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century .Well , this is very interesting because {Mr. Gao} [919] left {China} [920] before Tianenmen .He wrote a play , in particular about the events there .Would you say that {his} [919]{his influences} [928] may be more French literary then {they} [928] were {his} [919] own immediate life experience ?I would say {both} [928] , in fact , because the first play that {he} [919] wrote that made {him} [919] famous was a play that dates from 1981 , which was actually called ` Bus Stop \\' , which many people said or had resonances from {Beckett} [929] \\'s play ` Waiting for Godot \\' and it concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came .So , we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of {Beckett} [929] , but {Gao Xingjian} [919] really before 1989 felt , that {he} [919] was unable to write and to have {his} [919] plays produced , as {he} [919] would wish , and so left {China} [920] couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989 .I think {it} [930] is a great day for modern Chinese literature and {it} [930] is a day that has been awaited for the past 60 to 70 years .Gregory {Lee} [923] is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at {the University of Lyons} [924]{Lyons} [925] , {France} [921]{France .He} [931] spoke to {us} [932] from {his} [931] home in Provence .Professor , thank you very much for speaking with {us} [932] .Not at all .Thank you very much .This is {the World} [910] , I am Lisa Mullins .There are mounting allegations of police and military brutality in {Zimbabwe} [933] .But {President Robert Mugabe} [934] has deployed troops to quell rioting over the rising price of food .There are sharp increases here just as {Zimbabwe} [933] has slumped into {its} [933] worst economic crisis since becoming independent in 1980 .In {three days of unrest Army helicopters} [935] have dropped teargas in poor suburbs of the capital {Harare} [936] , but many of those protesting say {they} [935] wo n\\'t stop until Mugabe , the man {they} [935] blame for {the country} [916] \\'s economic problems , surrenders the presidency .From {Harare} [936] the BBC \\'s Grant Ferrett reports .Protestors in one of {Harare} [936] \\'s poor southern townships run for cover as riot police fire teargas from the top of an armored vehicle .Such confrontations have been taking place all over the south of the capital for several days .The aim is twofold , to demand a halt to the rising prices of basics such as food , fuel and transport , as well as the resignation of President Mugabe .People are demonstrating for the price increase fuel and everything .They are trying to stay away .They do n\\'t want to go to work .They want to stay away .So what happened here , can you tell me ?{We} [937] set {a barricade} [938] , not for {our} [937]{our people} [939] but for {the police} [940] .We do n\\'t want {them} [939] .We want {them} [939] to go .And what have {the police} [940] done ?{They} [940] are rounding up people to clear {our barricade} [938] , forcing {them} [938] , beating {them} [938] , throwing teargas canisters into school children , but the war here has just started .Nearly four months after {Zimbabwe} [933] \\'s bloodiest parliamentary elections , {the economy} [941] has gone from bad to worse .President {Mugabe} [934] \\'s vitriolic attacks on {the west} [927] combined with continuing lawlessness , particularly on white owned commercial farms have driven away donors , investors and tourists .Zimbabwe now has Africa \\'s fastest shrinking economy .Many of us like to characterize {Zimbabwe} [933] \\'s crisis as an economic crisis but it is wider and deeper than economy .Simba {Makoni} [942] looks and sounds like an opposition politician .In fact , {he} [942] is the recently appointed finance minister .You can see the price of bread go up , you can see your bus fares go up , you can see companies closing down or working short weeks and that sort of thing , but you can also read {Zimbabwe} [933] \\'s crisis in the number of destitute people on the streets , in the number of crimes being committed .245 !245 !{Zimbabwe} [933] earns the bulk of {its} [933] hard currency here on the tobacco auction floors .This year \\'s crop is down because of the continuing occupation of white owned farms .When the selling season ends next month , {foreign exchange reserves} [943] , hardly estimated to cover just a few days of imports , are likely to completely dry up .Without {them} [943] , paying for central imports such as fuel and electricity will become even more difficult .What we have right now is {a political crisis} [944] and until {that political crisis} [944] is resolved , there is no way {the economy} [941] is going to improve .The sentiments of economist Howard Setoli are widely shared .With eighteen months to go until scheduled presidential elections , {Zimbabwe} [933] is headed for complete economic ruin .If {government} [945] continues on {its} [945] current path , {the economy} [941] will continue to contract .This year {it} [941] was expected to contract by 8 % .Next year we see a further contraction of 12 % .So we are talking of massive unemployment , severe foreign exchange shortage .It is an alarming prediction .For those taking part in the protests on the streets , after two decades in office they want {President Mugabe} [934] to go now .We want a new President .The situation is like {Yugoslavia} [917] now .We do n\\'t want {Mugabe} [934] .No more .For {The World} [910] , I am Grant Ferrett , in {Harare} [936] .From {BBC News} [849]{BBC News in London} [908]{London} [909] , I \\'m James Cawling , for {The World} [910] .Clashes between Israeli Army units and {Palestinians} [946] have continued into the night .That \\'s after another day of violence in which four {Palestinians} [946] were killed .Helicopter gunships were deployed around the West Bank village of Bagella .Exchanges of fire between Israelis and {Palestinians} [946] have also been reported around Jericho , {Greg Barrow} [947] reports .A day of violence across the West Bank and Gaza has been followed by more clashes after nightfall .Houses in the West Bank village of {Bagella} [948] have been attached by {Israeli helicopter gunships} [949] .An Israeli military spokesman said {they} [949] were deployed in response to gun fire from {Palestinians} [946] inside Bagella , which was aimed at the Jewish settlement of Kilo .The Israelis say the helicopters went into action firing machine guns , but unconfirmed reports from inside {Bagella} [948] suggested rockets may have been used .Greg {Barrow} [947] , {BBC News} [849] , Jerusalem .This is {the World} [910] I am Lisa Mullins .Well {we} [950] ca n\\'t tell you who won Florida , but in a moment {we} [950] will enter the musical question , who let the dogs out ?First up {we} [950] have the answer to {our} [950] geo quiz today .We are looking for a region of central {Italy} [951] bordering the Adriatic Sea .The area is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno , the highest peak of the Apennines .It also includes a lot of sheep , good clean - living , {healthy sheep , and an Italian entrepreneur} [952] has an idea about how to make a little money of {them} [952] .The answer is {Abruzzo} [953] .Journalist {Carlos Depalazai} [954] was in {Rome} [955] , {Italy} [951] and {Carlo} [956] how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of {the Abruzzo} [953]{Abruzzo} [953] ?{He} [954] is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in the Italy at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food .So {this guy} [954] came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet .So you can have access through your computer on your desk .Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted .So what does it mean to adopt {a sheep} [957] , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of {its} [957] progress on the farm in {Italy} [951] ?You are not actually adopting {the sheep} [957] in the sense that you can have {it} [957] with you .It looks like distant adoption , where you do n\\'t actually have the child in your home .You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .It works in the same way , so you have access on the web site of this little farm , in a little village of Abrutzi and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of money {the sheep} [957] is actually yours .All right , so the amount of money you have mentioned to {us} [958] is about 160 US dollars and for that you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling .You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of {the sheep} [957] and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door .Yeah , I mean {this} [959] is quite funny , but apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange I think what is really important is that {it} [959] is a sign of a new concern that is effecting Italian people .I mean {we} [958] are notoriously lover of good food .We have a generous attitude towards food , and this is a new stuff .The fact that you really care about a sheep in the way {she} [960] is fed , in the way {she} [960] is nurtured , in the way people are looking after it , because it \\'s a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on {your table} [961] up {the end} [962] .Wait a minute , you said that on {your table} [961]{your table at the end} [963]{the end} [962] .Yeah , at {the table} [963] {if} [964] {it} [964] becomes food for instance , which is an option .You are adopting {the sheep} [957] and whatever happens at the end it \\'s your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing .I mean usually when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving {an animal} [965] not eventually eating {it} [965] .I mean {this} [966] is an option which is available and I think {it} [966] is a sort of provocation .You know Italians now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like {Rome} [955] , Florence , Naples .In the past , {we} [967] were a population of shepherds or farmers .We had completely different attitude towards nature .It seems that {we} [967] are losing something , and {we} [967] need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that {the Environment Minister in Italy} [968]{Italy} [951] supported the initiative and {he} [968]{he himself} [968] adopted a sheep is significant .He took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of Italians towards nature and farms .Carlo De Blazia , journalist speaking to us from {Rome} [955] .Thank you very much {Carlo} [956] .Nice to talk to you .Thank you .Five years ago today , the agreement ending {the war in Bosnia} [969]{Bosnia} [970] was initialed in {Dayton} [971]{Dayton Ohio .Western leaders} [972] were n\\'t wild about relying on {Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic} [973] to help implement the accord , but {they} [972] felt {they} [972] had no choice .Five years later , the West and {the United States} [974] in particular are n\\'t counting on {the deposed leader} [973] for anything .They want to see {his} [973] successor Vojislav Kostinica extradite {Milosevic} [973] through {the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague} [975]{The Hague} [976] , but not only is {Milosevic} [973] still living comfortable in {Belgrade} [977] , last night {he} [973] made {his} [973] first TV appearance in six weeks , giving a pep talk to {his} [973] supporters .The {World} [910] \\'s {Jeb Sharp} [978] reports on the still unresolved fate of {Slobodan Milosevic} [973] .He \\'s kept Western diplomats spinning in circles for more than a decade .Five years ago {they} [979] were negotiating with {Milosevic} [973] at {Dayton} [971] to stop {the war in Bosnia} [969]{Bosnia} [970] .Two years ago {they} [979] were still shuttling back and forth to {Belgrade} [977] in an effort to solve the Kosovo crisis .By March of last year {they} [979] had given up talking and {Nato} [980] had started bombing instead .When {Milosevic} [973] was indited on war crimes charges soon after , US and other Western officials began calling for {his} [973] arrest and transfer to {The Hague} [976] , but now that a delicate transition is underway in {Serbia} [981] , those calls have grown quieter , according to Gary Bass , the author of the new book about war crimes trials , ` Stay , the Hand of Vengeance \\' .Even Madeleine Albright , who is with the President who is usually most decipherous about the importance of prosecuting war criminals , has in fact said that our first priority is making sure that {Vojislov Kostunica} [982] can consolidate {his} [982]{his democratic government} [983] and make that transition , and the issue of punishing war criminals sort of takes a back seat .Bass says US diplomats do n\\'t want to risk destabilizing {Serbia} [981] \\'s fragile political situation by pushing too hard for war crimes trials .After all Bass points out , outside pressure has backfired in the past .In Germany after {World War I} [984] and in the Ottoman Empire also after {World War I} [984] , the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials , and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash .A nationalist backlash in {Serbia} [981] right now could play into {Milosevic} [973] \\'s hands , especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for next month .That \\'s one reason Western governments are not demanding {his} [973] immediate arrest , but critics of this approach say letting {Milosevic} [973] stay in {Belgrade} [977] could be equally destabilizing .Eva Barnetts , professor of history at Yale , says {President Kostunica} [982] should cooperate immediately with {the Hague Tribunal} [975] .This {particular UN institution} [985] has in {its} [985] power really to give instant legitimacy to {Kostunica} [982] but of course at a price .It means that {the government of Yugoslavia} [983]{Yugoslavia} [986] has to become very serious about dealing with the indited war criminals , beginning with {Slobodan Milosevic} [973]{Slobodan Milosevic himself} [973] .But {even officials at The Hague} [987]{The Hague} [976] say {they} [987] are willing to be patient with {the new Yugoslav President .Tribunal spokesman Jim Landel} [988] says {it} [988] helps that {Kostunica} [982] \\'s people who initially refused to even entertain the idea of arresting {Milosevic} [973] , may be starting to cooperate with {the Tribunal} [975] .They have already indicated that {they} [987] are willing to allow the reopening of {the prosecutor} [989] \\'s liaison office in {Belgrade} [977] , and that \\'s certainly a welcome first step .However , it is only a first step .The {Tribunal \\'s chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte} [990] has applied for a Yugoslav visa and plans to visit {Belgrade} [977] soon .Delponte \\'s spokeswoman says {the prosecutor} [989] has much to discuss with {Kostunica} [982] , not least how to arrest all the indited war crimes suspects now in {Serbia} [981] .That wo n\\'t be easy .Even in {Bosnia} [970] where {Nato} [980] is in charge , troops have failed to capture {Bosnian - Serb leader Radavan Karadzic} [991] , indited on genocide charges in connection with the 1995 massacre at Shrabanitca .Yale history professor Eva Barnett says the excuses for not arresting {Karadzic} [991] are not persuasive .The claim is that this would engender tremendously destabilizing consequences that in any event it might be a very , very bloody affair and so on .This does not seem terribly compelling to me .I think that it has to be tried and of course there is always a danger that somebody might get hurt in this , but that is a danger that every attempt at remedying criminal activity has to face .Hague {prosecutor Carla Del Ponte} [990] is prepared to discuss arrest strategies with {Kostunica} [982] including the use of foreign troops .It \\'s difficult to know how {he} [982] would react {.Kostunica} [982] has questioned the legality of {the Hague Tribunal} [975] , and talked of trying {Milosevic} [973] in {Yugoslavia} [986] .Still , {Kostunica} [982] \\'s grace period wo n\\'t last forever .When {the US Congress} [992] approved one hundred million dollars in {aid to Serbia} [993]{Serbia} [981] last month , {it} [992] stipulated {the aid} [993] would stop flowing if {Belgrade} [977] has n\\'t cooperated with {the tribunal} [975] by March 31st .For {The World} [910] , I am {Jeb Sharp} [978] .This is {The World} [910] .I am Lisa Mullins .Both {George W. Bush} [994]{George W. Bush and Al Gore} [995]{Al Gore} [996] today continue to press {their} [995] cases literally and figuratively .Their PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly .Governor {Bush} [994] \\'s running mate Dick Cheney talked with reporters about the Republican transition plans , another signal that {Bush} [994] is getting ready to become the next President of {the United States} [974] .Meanwhile , {Vice President Gore} [996] continued {his} [996] appeal for patience while {he} [996] contests {Bush} [994] \\'s claim to victory , and attorneys for both men were preparing for key court battles later in the week , which could settle the three - week dispute over who won {Florida} [997] and the presidency .The {World} [910]{World \\'s Clark Boyd} [998] has the latest .All eyes were on {Florida} [997] yet again today as lawyers , judges , lawmakers and citizens , all picked at the knots that have tied up the conclusion of {this presidential election} [999] for the past three weeks .Yesterday in {Leon County Circuit Court} [1000] , {Judge N. Sander Sauls} [1001] set a Saturday deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and {Palm Beach} [1002] counties , not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth , to be brought to Tallahassee under police escort .Today , as officials in both two counties ready the ballots for transport , {George W. Bush} [994]{George W. Bush \\'s} [994] lawyers asked {the judge} [1001] to order all 1.16 million ballots from the two counties to be trucked to the state capital .Late this afternoon , {Judge Sauls} [1001]{Sauls} [1001] granted that motion .In {Washington} [1003] , {Vice President Al Gore} [996] was back on television this morning trying to shore up public support for {his} [996] legal cause .In a taped interview , for NBC \\'s Today Show , {Gore} [996] said despite all the legal maneuvering {he} [996] is calling on both camps to put partisan politics aside .I think that both {Governor Bush and I} [1004] should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of our partisan supporters .Meanwhile , {Bush} [994] \\'s vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy man today .After a heart checkup at a {Washington} [1003] hospital {he} [996] appeared at a news conference to say that {he} [996] is pressing ahead with transition plans .We have now acquired office space in McClain , Virginia that will become the site for the transition operation that {we} [1005] announced two days ago , so {we} [1005] are just in a business of getting up and running , but {we} [1005] now have an office with a lot of space .We have got people signing up , volunteers coming on , telephones being put in and computers , so {we} [1005] will be fully operational within the next day or two .Earlier today in {Florida} [997] , the Republican dominated legislature began hearings on calling a special session to pick {the state} [997] \\'s electors itself , should the December 12th deadline still find {the election} [999] tied up in the courts .The committee heard from angry voters and precinct workers in {Palm Beach} [1002] .I believe our issues do relate directly to the appointing of electors for the state of {Florida} [997] .The electors need to be appointed , are supposed to be appointed according to {the will of the people} [1006]{the people} [1007] and I believe in Palm Beach County that it was very difficult to determine what {the will of the people} [1006]{the people} [1007] was .Although {Al Gore} [996] said today that {he} [996] certainly feels like {he} [996] won {the election} [999] , {he} [996] put {his} [996] odds of wining the various legal battles at fifty - fifty .Gore said , if {Bush} [994] does triumph in court , {he} [994] will throw {his} [994] support behind the Republican President - elect .But for now , says {former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche} [1009]{Clinton} [1008] administration cabinet member Robert Riche , {both sides} [1010] are positive that {they} [1010] \\'ve won {the election} [999] , and says {Riche} [1009] , {the} [1011] longer the fight goes on , {the} [1011] more troublesome the next four years might be .What we risk by prolonging this is greater public cynicism and a hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to work together .After all , come January , these people are going to have to be in {Washington} [1003] whether {Gore} [996]{Gore or Bush} [1004]{Bush} [994] is {the President} [996] .You have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work together with {the new President} [994] and with each other , so we do n\\'t want to prolong this forever .The {US Supreme Court} [1000] will hear arguments from {both sides} [1010] on Friday and {Florida} [997] \\'s {Leon County Circuit Court} [1000] will consider the arguments on disputed state ballots on Saturday , and while the nation wearies of the protracted legal battle maybe {Leon County Circuit Court} [1000] judge {N. Sander Sauls} [1001] said it best .The whole process , {he} [1001] said , is a bit like being nibbled to death by a duck .For {The World} [910] , this is {Clark Boyd} [998] .Russia \\'s lower house of {parliament} [1012] has overwhelmingly approved restoring {the former Soviet anthem} [1013] as {the Russian national anthem} [1013]{Russian} [1014] national anthem .The move had the strong support of {Russian} [1014] President Vladimir Putin who said use of {the old anthem} [1013] represented a gesture of reconciliation .Critics argued that {the anthem} [1013] is a throwback to the former totalitarian government .The {anthem} [1013] will have new words , eliminating verses that praised Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin .The lower house of {parliament} [1012] also gave formal endorsement to Russia \\'s white , red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military .From BBC news in London , I am Gregor Cragey for {The World} [910]{The World .George W.

, and I ca n\\'t thank {the President} [994] enough for {his} [994] hospitality .He did n\\'t need to do this .Yes , {he} [994] did .I have n\\'t quite finished yet .And I am grateful and I am going to look forward to the discussion .I am here to listen .For {his} [994] part {President Clinton} [1008] said {his} [1008] only advice to {Bush} [994] is to assemble a good team and to do what {he} [994] thinks is right .Bush is now heading back to {Texas} [1016] .The {Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak} [1017] is due to meet with Egypt \\'s President Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday .The encounter is being seen as an effort by {Barak} [1017] to drum up regional support for a Middle East peace agreement based on {President Clinton} [1008] \\'s proposals .They require {Israel} [1018] to relinquish sovereignty over most of Arab East Jerusalem and {the Palestinians} [1019] to scale back {their} [1019] demand for a return of refugees , but Palestinian chief negotiator Sayeb Erekat says more details are required before {both sides} [1010] can strike a deal .We have so many questions that {we} [1020] have ... so many points that need to be clarified .The most important thing is the clarity .The most important thing is that {we} [1020] focus on the travails of the peace process {.Israeli settlers} [1021] are worried that most of the settlements in {the West Bank} [1022] will be dismantled if an agreement is reached .The spokeswoman for {this Settlers \\'} [1021] Council Yahudi Tayar says this is unacceptable .We have a situation where instead of protecting the interests of the Jewish people , {the Israeli Prime Minister} [1017] is willing to forgo on all of the vital and important areas and not only our history , but the security of the future for the Jewish people in {Israel} [1018] .More than 300 people have been killed in the West Bank and {Gaza Strip} [1023] since {September .The head of the Palestinian Television and Radio} [1024] has been shot dead in {the

University economist , {Steve Hanky} [1041] says {Yugoslavia} [1033]{Yugoslavia \\'s new President Vojislav Kostunica} [1042] only has a few weeks to reassure financial stability in {the dominant republic of Serbia} [1043]{Serbia} [1044] by stabilizing the inflation - prone Yugoslav dinar .VOA \\'s Barry Wood spoke with Mr. Hanky , who recently returned from several weeks in Europe .Mr. {Hanky} [1041] says that {President Kostunica} [1042] has only two options for achieving financial stability in {Serbia} [1044] .He can either abandon {the dinar} [1045] and adopt the German mark as {the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro} [1043]{Montenegro} [1046] has done or , {Mr. Hanky} [1041] says , {Serbia} [1044] can adopt a currency board system under which a new currency would be issued under conditions of utmost financial discipline .I think if {Kostunica} [994] does not move in a direction decisively within the next month of abandoning {the dinar} [1045] completely or going to a deutsche {mark} [1047] based currency board where we have a foreign governor on the board , the chances for economic unification in the area and economic recovery in {Serbia} [1044] are slim at best .Mr. {Hanky} [1041] says it \\'s essential that {President Kostunica} [994] embrace the principle of sound money , something {Mr. Hanky} [1041] believes is as important as the rule of law .Last week , {the new acting head of the Yugoslav Central Bank} [1024]{the Yugoslav Central Bank} [1022] devalued {the dinar} [1045] , bringing {it} [1024] to 30 to the dollar , compared to the previous official rate of 20 .Mr. Hanky , who regards {the dinar} [1045] as {the world} [910] \\'s worst currency , says {the deutsch mark} [1047] is becoming the de facto money in {the entire Balkan region} [1048] .If {they} [1047] use {the d mark} [1047] in {Serbia} [1044] , obviously there would be essentially the same system that {they} [1047] have in {Montenegro} [1046] and if {they} [1047] had a currency board with a foreign national running the thing , like Bosnia , it would essentially mean that {they} [1047] had a unified system was what {they} [1047] have in {Montenegro} [1046] because with {Montenegro} [1046] , {they} [1047] would still have the d mark as legal tender , but {they} [1047] would also use this new currency board money from {Serbia} [1044] and there would be absolutely no problem , and furthermore , from a regional point of view , you \\'d have essentially most of {the Balkans} [1038] in a unified currency zone because Bulgaria has a currency board that \\'s d mark based .Bosnia has a currency board that \\'s d mark based .Kosovo has a d mark , {Montenegro} [1046] has a d mark .Mr. {Hanky} [1041] was instrumental in developing {the deutsche mark based currency systems throughout the region} [1049]{the region} [1048] .Advisors to {Mr. Kostunica} [994] say {they} [1049] are considering a currency board system for {Serbia} [1044] .Barry Wood , {VOA News} [1025] , {Washington}

Governor of {Texas} [1016] , the Republican nominee , holds a 49 % to 42 % advantage over {his} [1052] Democratic opponent Al Gore , the Vice President , but two other major surveys gave {Mr. Bush} [994] only a one - point lead .On {Sunday} [1053] , {several major newspapers} [1054] weighed in with {their} [1054] endorsements and {VOA} [1034]{VOA \\'s Peter Hymline} [1055] has that story .In {its} [1055] Sunday editions , {the New York Times} [1056] calls {Vice President Gore} [1057] , {the man} [994] best equipped for {the presidency} [1058] by virtue of {his} [994] knowledge of government , {his} [994] experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision making and {his} [994] devotion to the general welfare .The {Times} [1056]{Times editorial} [1059] says {Mr. Gore} [1057] has , in {its} [1059] words , struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration \\'s ethical lapses .The paper \\'s editorial board goes on to say , we believe {Mr. Gore} [1057] would never follow {Bill Clinton \\'s} [1060] example of reckless conduct that cheapens {the Presidency} [1058] .The {Times} [1056] also praise {Republican candidate George W Bush} [994] for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but {the writers} [1061] said {they} [1061] had concluded {Mr. Bush} [994] \\'s agenda was harsh on issues

growing children .For Taiwanese expatriates in {mainland China} [1129] , incompatibility between {the Taiwanese and mainland education systems} [1130] is the main reason why most of {them} [1130] do not move {their} [1130] families across with {them} [1130] .In the city of Dongguan , located just over 40 kilometers east of Guangzhou , the ground has already been broken on a project to build the first school for {Taiwanese} [1131] children in {mainland China} [1129] .There is an especially large {Taiwanese} [1131] expatriate community in the Dongguan area , and there are high hopes that the new school , scheduled to begin officially enrolling students in September , will go a long way toward solving the nettlesome problem of education .\" Sometimes I get to thinking that I \\'ve achieved

Ye} [1132] notes that there are now about 400 children of Taiwanese expatriates in {Dongguan} [1144] who attend school in {the mainland} [1129] .Greater than half attend {mainland China} [1129] \\'s regular elementary and secondary schools , while {the more affluent Taiwanese} [1158] send {their} [1158] children to private schools for expatriate children .Chang Mei - liang , chairperson of {the TBAD Women \\'s Division} [1140] , is among the latter group .After {her} [1159]{her elder son and daughter} [1160] finished elementary school in {Taiwan} [1139] {she} [1159] sent {them} [1160] to a boarding school in Britain .Her {ten - year - old child} [1161] is too young for that though , so {she} [1159] sends {him} [1161] to a school in {Shenzhen} [1162] for the children of {Hong Kong} [1163] expats .The child only comes home once a week , and sending {him} [1161] to {the school in Shenzhen} [1150]{Shenzhen} [1162] costs several hundred thousand NT dollars per year .The {Hong Kong} [1163]{Hong Kong elementary school and the international school} [1164]{the international school} [1150] are both an hour or two away from {Dongguan} [1144] , and many of the Taiwanese in {Dongguan} [1144] want to be able to see {their} [1164] children every day .This prompted a group of {them} [1164] to establish a private bilingual school called {Little Oxford} [1165] in February 1998 .The school admits children from kindergarten -LRB- age five -RRB- through grade five of elementary school .Some of {Little Oxford} [1165]{Oxford} [1166] \\'s 200 students -LRB- such as {Norman Hsu \\'s} [1147] child -RRB- used to go to school in {Shenzhen} [1162] , while others have transferred in from the mainland Chinese public school system .Little {Oxford} [1166] is very similar to {the Taiwanese school} [1150] being promoted by the TBAD .Most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s elementary schools , and of the 15 or so teachers there , three are from {Taiwan} [1139] .The big difference is that classes are taught in both Chinese and English because {the Taiwanese parents} [1167] are very interested in seeing that {their} [1167] children learn English well .According to Huang Su , executive director of {Little Oxford} [1165] , \" A lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children \\'s education is exactly like the regular system in {Taiwan} [1139] , but I have to remind {them} [1167] that once you \\'ve left in {Taiwan} [1139] , you \\'re not regular any longer . \"According to {Huang} [1168] , making {the school} [1150] a mirror image of those in {Taiwan} [1139] does not necessarily mean that you are running a good school .The key is to provide an education that meets the needs of the students .In addition to {Taiwanese} [1169] teaching materials , {she} [1169] has also incorporated some materials from {the mainland} [1129] and overseas into the curriculum .Huang Su , who hails from Beijing , majored in English at university and is keenly interested in education .She came to {Dongguan} [1144] after marrying a {Taiwanese} [1149] expat there , and it was the Taiwanese business community that asked {her} [1169] to run a school .Little {Oxford} [1166] now has a very good reputation in the Taiwanese community .In fact , {some Taiwanese} [1170]{Taiwanese} [1149] send {their} [1170] children to {Little Oxford} [1165] from as far away as Zhuhai -LRB- just opposite Macau on the other side of the Pearl River estuary -RRB- {.Huang} [1171] has been deeply impressed by the deep concern that {Taiwanese parents} [1172] show for {their} [1172] children \\'s education in the face of difficulties posed by living away from {their} [1172] native {Taiwan} [1139] .One parent , for example , practically begged {her} [1169] to admit {his} [1173] six - year old child , explaining , \" {He} [1173] \\'s never had any playmates .The only people {he} [1173] \\'s ever been with are {his} [1173] nanny and some employees from the plant . \"The Taiwanese kids at {Little Oxford} [1165]{Oxford} [1166] come from many different backgrounds .Some speak in a mixture of Chinese and English , while {others} [1174] speak and look just like any mainland Chinese child .Many of {them} [1174] have transferred in and out of lots of different schools in the United States , {Taiwan} [1139] , and {the mainland} [1129] .There is no trace of {the world} [1175] \\'s cares on {their} [1174] faces though ; the thing {they} [1174] \\'re most concerned about is studying a little less and playing a little more .One bespectacled child laments , \" School is better in Canada because {they} [1174] do n\\'t have to do so much homework .There \\'s too much homework in {Taiwan} [1139] and {the mainland} [1129] .It \\'s no fun . \"{An older brother and sister} [1176] , it turns out , have {both} [1176] lived overseas {.Huang} [1171] stays in close touch with {the Taiwanese parents} [1167] .Their {children} [1177] enjoy very comfortable homes and seem to have experienced much of {the world} [1175] , but the biggest problem is that \" {they} [1177] are n\\'t motivated and do n\\'t understand why {they} [1177] should need to study . \"Another problem for {the school} [1150] is the lack of interesting things to do in {Dongguan} [1144] .Unless {teachers} [1178] are very devoted to education , {they} [1178] are not likely to stay there long .\" It \\'s all the more difficult , \" notes {Huang} [1168] frankly , \" to hold on to teachers from {Taiwan} [1139] , who ca n\\'t help but compare {their} [1178] situation here with what {they} [1178] are accustomed to in {Taiwan} [1139] . \"{The Taiwanese school} [1150] will be faced with the same high turnover rate that has dogged {Little Oxford} [1165]{Oxford} [1166] .Dongguan , cradle of scholarsWith Little {Oxford} [1166] already in operation , why should {the Taiwanese expats} [1179] wish to establish a separate school for {their} [1179] children ?Sylvia Yang points out that {Little Oxford} [1165] is a private school with limited space and teaching staff , and even without the boarding expenses charged in {Shenzhen} [1162] , the tuition at {Little Oxford} [1165]{Oxford} [1166] still costs RMB 38,000 -LRB- NT$ 160,000 -RRB- per semester , more than many Taiwanese parents can pay .Says {H. D. Ye} [1132] , \" We would like to get funding from both the {Taiwan} [1139] and mainland authorities to hold tuition down . \"Although {the cornerstone} [1157] has already been laid , {Ye} [1132] reports that not enough funds have been raised , nor have all the teachers been hired .Although the picture generally looks pretty good , there is still much work to be done .Expenses for the first few years are expected to reach NT$ 60 million , and only about NT$ 20 million has been raised so far .Ye often speaks in {Taiwan} [1139] on the topic of investing in {the mainland} [1129] , something which he knows a lot about .Says {Ye} [1132] jokingly , \" I jack up my speaking fees to make extra money for {the school} [1150] . \"The TBAD is now considering funding {the school} [1150] through an endowment , shares in which would be sold to business firms .The location for {the school} [1150] has already been selected .It is a large site in the township of {Zhongtang} [1180] .The lot is basically empty right now , but the roar of excavators fills the air , and the steel piles have already been driven .The school grounds are located next to the ancient Beidi Temple , which is shaded by the leaves of a spreading banyan tree .On the temple gate a fading couplet reads : \" {He} [1181] who is truly dedicated to {his} [1181] endeavor will become a great master , and shall make of {his} [1181] surroundings a land of delight .He who has achieved true wisdom shall make of {his} [1181] home a cynosure for great talent , no matter where {he} [1181] may be . \"The locals must have taken {this message} [1182] to heart over the years , because {it} [1182] is said that hometown scholars from {Zhongtang} [1180] often took the top spot in the imperial examinations of centuries past .It is very gratifying that a place like {Dongguan} [1144] , with {its} [1144] abundant business opportunities , should also have a scenic spot so rich in scholarly tradition .It is also exciting to look forward to the founding of a school for the Taiwanese business community .Apart from making money , will the expatriates here create a \" Taiwanese miracle \" on the cultural front as well ?p. 91Little Oxford , a bilingual elementary school attended primarily by the children of Taiwanese expatriates , guards its entranceway closely .A school bus takes students to and from school , and {all visitors} [1183] must announce {themselves} [1183] before entering .p. 92Little {Oxford} [1166] elementary school teaches classes in both Chinese and English , which is just what {the Taiwanese expatriates} [1184] want for {their} [1184] children .p. 93H. {D.

in - chief of {Hong Kong} [1163] \\'s OPEN magazine , which specializes in political reporting and commentary , spent an entire week in {Taiwan} [1139] observing the election campaign and {its} [1139] aftermath , and on 20 March , OPEN organized a seminar titled \" The New President and Cross-Strait Relations . \"{The seminar} [1185] was held in cooperation with Taiwan News , one of the island \\'s oldest English - language newspapers -LRB- known until last year as the China News -RRB- .The KMT ticket finished nearly 14 percentage points behind independent candidate James Soong and pulled in fully two million votes fewer than {the DPP ticket} [1186] , a margin of defeat which {Jin Zhong} [1187] described in {his} [1187] opening remarks as stunning .When Chinese Communist premier Zhu Rongji made belligerent remarks a few days before {the election} [1188] in an effort to scare voters away from {the DPP ticket} [1186] , {the ruling party} [1189] made a grievous mistake , opined Jin , when {it} [1189] failed to come out strongly critical of Zhu and attempted instead to capitalize on the incident by playing the \" fear card . \"At the same time , however , winning candidate Chen Shui - bian captured only 39 % of the vote , which translates to a weak mandate .As a result , {he} [1187] must take a moderate line that stresses inter-party cooperation .He will have to include a wide range of people in {his} [1187] government , keep a low profile , guard against any temptation to grow imperious in power , and strive to be a president of all the people .As for {mainland China} [1129] \\'s saber - rattling , {Jin} [1190] argued that there is no need for undue concern .Stated {Jin} [1190] , \" The consequences would be too severe .It \\'s not like {Taiwan} [1139] is without any means of retaliation .Are the mainland authorities really prepared to see {Hong Kong} [1163] and {Shanghai} [1191] go up in flames ? \"There are other perspectives on cross-strait relations , of course .The seminar participants basically fell into three camps on future prospects .Some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy .Perhaps the most optimistic view was expressed by Ruan Ming , a visiting professor at Tamkang University \\'s Department of China Studies who in the 1980s was an assistant to former Chinese Communist Secretary General Hu Yaobang .Ruan stated that {Beijing} [1192] \\'s basic position on {Taiwan} [1139] has not changed at all since the days of Deng Xiaoping .\" There \\'s nothing new in what they \\'re saying . \"The only thing {the Chinese Communists} [1193] are saying , says {Ruan} [1194] , is that {they} [1193] will attack \" if {Taiwan} [1139] makes any sort of formal move toward independence , \" and {Taiwan} [1139] has no need to formalize anything because changing {the country} [1139] \\'s name would be meaningless .\" No matter what you call yourself , people are still going to call you {Taiwan} [1139] .It \\'s just like in England - the official name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , but nobody calls it that .And there \\'s no need to going around shouting , \\' {We} [1195] \\'re a country ! {We} [1195] \\'re a country ! \\'Who in the international community does that ? \"Pragmatism , please\" {Taiwan} [1139] needs to be more pragmatic , \" says {Ruan} [1194] , \" just like {the mainland} [1129] . \"{They} [1196] made a lot of noise ahead of the election trying to sway votes , but once {the election} [1188] was over {they} [1196] backpedaled quickly with the simple statement , \" {We} [1196] \\'ll wait and see what {they} [1196] say and do . \"The attitude with {them} [1196] , in {Ruan} [1194] \\'s view , is very pragmatic .Ruan is optimistic about cross-strait relations under the new regime , and states , \" {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] is best positioned to improve cross-strait relations . \"{He} [1197] likens {Chen} [1197] to the staunchly anti-communist Richard Nixon , who was able to normalize ties with {the Chinese Communists} [1193] precisely because {he} [1197] was trusted by the American people .Similarly , when {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] negotiates with {Beijing} [1192] , no one will worry about {him} [1197] selling {Taiwan} [1139] down the river .The noted political commentator Chin Heng - wei , chief editor of {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s Contemporary Monthly , agreed strongly with Ruan \\'s comments , and added , \" In {this election} [1188] {the people of Taiwan} [1198]{Taiwan} [1139] were even more concerned about domestic issues than {they} [1198] were about cross-strait relations . \"The most pressing issues facing the new president are education , the environment , \" black gold \" politics -LRB- murky connections between the worlds of politics , business , and organized crime -RRB- , and crime fighting .When Nobel laureate Lee Yuan - tseh came out in support of {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] , implying that {the DPP} [1199] represented \" the progressive forces in society , \" {Chen} [1197] \\'s support jumped immediately upward .Virtually everyone at {the seminar} [1185] was in agreement that {it} [1185] is neither advisable nor necessary to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue , and that {Taiwan} [1139] need only avoid stirring up Chinese nationalism .Wei Chengsi -LRB- news director at ATV news in {Hong Kong} [1163] and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in {Shanghai} [1191] -RRB- emphasized the fluid nature of {Beijing} [1192] \\'s policy on {Taiwan} [1139] .He feels that the mainland authorities face many more pressing issues than {Taiwan} [1139] , and that the current tension basically stems from President Lee Teng - hui \\'s pronouncement on state - to - state relations .Having been through the Tiananmen massacre , Wei felt compelled to warn {the people of Taiwan} [1198]{Taiwan} [1139] , \" You absolutely must not think the way the students did in {Beijing} [1192] in \\'89 .You must not think that \\' {the communists} [1193] wo n\\'t attack because the US wo n\\'t let {them} [1193] , \\' and then go out of your way to provoke {them} [1193] to where {they} [1193] no longer have an out .Under the wrong circumstances , failure to display strong Chinese nationalism could spell political suicide for {a Communist Party leader} [1200] , and {he} [1200] might well decide , \\' To hell with the US and economic development , I \\'ve got to attack if I \\'m to stay in power . \\'That would be an incredible disaster . \"Chiu Hsiang - chung , chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal , also advocated cautious optimism .In {his} [1200] view , there has been no fundamental change in the cross-strait relationship , but {he} [1200] listed a few variables that bear close watching .The first is the combination of nationalism and {Jiang Zemin \\'s} [1201] desire to serve another term as Secretary General of {the Communist Party} [1202] and make {his} [1201] mark on history .Could {he} [1201] attempt to use nationalism to further {his} [1201] ambition ?Second , the People \\'s Liberation Army hopes to parlay the {Taiwan} [1139] issue into increased influence in domestic politics .Third , {Taiwan} [1139] could make mistakes and give {the Chinese Communists} [1193] an excuse for military action .And a fourth factor is the wishy - washy American support for {Taiwan} [1139] .If all of these variables combined in the wrong way , the military authorities could make a miscalculation that would lead to war .When hawk meets hawkChou Chi - ping -LRB- senior advisor at Business Weekly -RRB- and Tseng Fu - sheng -LRB- general secretary of {the KMT} [1203] \\'s Department of Mainland Operations -RRB- felt that the future of cross-strait relations is still up in the air .Chou , as a former official with the Straits Exchange Foundation , has had direct dealings with {the Chinese Communists} [1193] .He argued that {the DPP} [1199] \\'s view of {the mainland} [1129] has always been colored by ideology , and thus take a dim view of the other side .It is true , acknowledges {Chou} [1204] , that {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] has changed {his} [1197] basic stance and now says that {he} [1197] \" will not change {the country} [1139] \\'s name , declare independence , or seek to enshrine the state - to - state principle in the constitution . \"It is also true that Lee Yuan - tseh -LRB- who is highly respected in {the mainland} [1129] for his academic achievements -RRB- has vouched for the sensibility of {Chen} [1197] \\'s approach to cross-strait relations .And yes , once again , it is true that {the Chinese Communists} [1193] have muted {their} [1193] rhetoric considerably .Nevertheless , the two sides view each other with suspicion .If {the Chinese Communists} [1193] conclude that {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s leadership has dropped {its} [1139] insistence on formal independence only to pursue a policy that includes de facto independence as {its} [1139] aim , {Chou} [1204] argued that this will introduce a note of uncertainty into the relationship .Tseng {Fu - sheng} [1205] feels that {Taiwan} [1139] should claim the high ground by holding up {its} [1139] experience in democratization as an example for {the Chinese Communists} [1193] .Says {Tseng} [1206] , \" Reunification depends entirely on whether China can democratize . \"{His} [1205] biggest worry is that the deep gulf between {the DPP and the mainland authorities} [1207] could cause {them} [1207] to misread each other .He stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between {Beijing} [1192] , Washington , and Taipei .If the hawks gained the upper hand at the same time in all three capitals , {opined Tseng} [1206]{Tseng} [1206] , the result could be war .The seminar attendants also examined {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s domestic situation .Versatile author and cultural commentator Ping Lu offered some very incisive comments regarding the post-election protests outside the KMT headquarters .In demanding that Lee Teng - hui resign as chairman of {the KMT} [1203] to take responsibility for the election defeat , Ping -LRB- herself a second - generation \" mainlander \" -RRB- argued that the protest revealed an ethnic fault line in Taiwanese society .It was a venting of mass frustration on the part of one particular ethnic group , said Ping , noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders .This {group} [1208] feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of {KMT} [1203] rule {they} [1208] have always thought of {themselves} [1208] as a privileged \" majority \" in {Taiwan} [1139] even though in fact {they} [1208] are a minority .They do not identify with {Taiwan} [1139] as {their} [1208] home , and {they} [1208] have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority .In some ways {the election} [1188] has forced {them} [1208] to realize that {they} [1208] truly are a minority .This development should help to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in {Taiwan} [1139] .The participants generally felt that {the election} [1188] was a victory for democracy .On the domestic front , the victory of {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort to banish \" black gold \" from the political arena .In cross-strait relations {Chen} [1197] \\'s victory spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted within the framework of a civil war between {he} [1197] {KMT} [1203] and {the Chinese Communist Party} [1202] .Reform of {the KMT} [1203] and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in {Taiwan} [1139] .It appears that {the people of Taiwan} [1198]{Taiwan} [1139] have finally taken {their} [1198] first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect .President Chen Travels Abroad-LRB- Chang Chiung -

chang , Helen Chu , Feng Ting - kuo , and Li Yin - yun .-LRB- Li is soon to assume a position as deputy director of the {ROC} [1214] diplomatic post in Washington , DC . -RRB-The total size of {the delegation} [1225] came to nearly 200 people , including more than 50 journalists .The {president} [1217] kept to a very tight schedule during {the trip} [1224] .After a brief stopover in {Los Angeles} [1226] on {the 13th} [1223] , {Chen} [1197] continued on and reached {the Dominican Republic} [1214] on the 14th .He attended {the presidential inauguration} [1215] there on the 16th , and was able to meet with the leaders and representatives of friendly nations from around the world .On the 17th {he} [1197] continued on to {Nicaragua} [1218] , where {he} [1197] met with {President Arnoldo Aleman} [1227] and delivered a speech to {the Nicaraguan National Assembly} [1210] .On {the 18th} [1228] , presidents {Chen} [1197] and {Aleman} [1227] signed a joint communique before {Chen Shui - bian} [1197] departed for {Costa Rica} [1221] , where {he} [1197] received the Great Cross of Juan Mora Fernandez , a gold medal which is the nation \\'s highest award .On the 20th {he} [1197] flew across the Atlantic Ocean to {Gambia} [1219] to meet with {Gambian President Yahya Jameh} [1229] before heading on to {Burkina Faso} [1222] and a dinner with President Blaise Compaore .On {the 23rd Chen} [1230]{Chen} [1197] delivered a speech to the Gambian parliament .The next stop on the itinerary was Chad , where {Chen} [1197] dined with Chad \\'s President Idris Debi .On the 25th {Chen} [1197] and Debi signed a joint communique and held a press conference before heading back to {Taiwan} [1139] slightly ahead of schedule to oversee efforts to deal with the powerful Typhoon Bilis .Chen \\'s stopover in {Los Angeles} [1226] was a sensitive subject , for {Chen} [1197] had originally planned an informal meeting with several members of the US Congress .After furious protests from {Beijing} [1192] and discouragement from the US State Department , however , {Chen} [1197] canceled the plan just the day before arriving in {Los Angeles} [1226] .A crowd of 500 to 600 Taiwanese living in the United States showed up to greet {the president} [1227] at {his} [1227]{his hotel} [1231] and protest against the US government \\'s \" caving in to {Beijing} [1192] at the expense of {Taiwan} [1139] . \"When {Chen} [1197] arrived on the 14th in {the Dominican Republic} [1214] , {he} [1197] was greeted at {the airport} [1232] by over 100 representatives of the Taiwanese business community there , and more than 700 Taiwanese residents threw a party for {the president} [1227] that night at {his} [1227]{his hotel} [1231] .The next day , {Chen} [1197] took advantage of {the upcoming presidential inauguration} [1215] to meet with leaders from a number of countries with which {the ROC} [1214]{ROC} [1214] has diplomatic relations , including the vice-president of El Salvador and the second vice president of Panama .On {the 16th Chen} [1230]{Chen} [1197] attended {the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia} [1215]{President Hipolito Mejia} [1216] .The {ROC} [1214] contingent was larger than any other at the ceremony .The {ROC} [1214] currently has diplomatic relations with 29 countries , half of which are located in {Latin America} [1212] and the Caribbean .In recent years , however , {mainland China} [1214] has continually upgraded {its} [1214] trade links with {the ROC} [1214]{ROC} [1214] \\'s diplomatic partners .The allegiance of a number of these countries may be put to the test in the coming years by various political and economic considerations .In the case of {the Dominican Republic} [1214] , for example , {supporters of President Mejia} [1233]{President Mejia} [1216] announced to the media on the eve of {President Chen} [1197] \\'s arrival that {mainland China} [1214] was planning to build a large thermal power plant in {their} [1233] country .In addition , {the Dominican Republic} [1214] is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council in 2002 , and will certainly be lobbying for {Beijing} [1192] \\'s support .This situation could affect relations with {Taiwan} [1139] .On the bright side , {Taiwan} [1139] has scored a few points of {its} [1139] own in this diplomatic tug of war .When {Chen} [1197] arrived in {Costa Rica} [1221] on {the 18th} [1228] , {his} [1197] hosts departed from the pattern of the past few years by promising to support {the ROC s} [1214]{ROC} [1214] s bid for membership in {the United Nations} [1234] .Costa Rica \\'s President Miguel Rodriguez also accompanied {President Chen} [1197] on a tour of a Taiwanese export processing zone , an orchid farm run by Taiwan Sugar Corporation , and a vocational training school .President {Chen} [1197] departed on the 20th for {Africa} [1213] , where {the ROC} [1214]{ROC} [1214] has eight diplomatic partners .Chen {Shui - bian} [1211] is the first {ROC} [1214] president ever to travel to western {Africa} [1213] .There is little two - way trade between {Taiwan} [1139] and any of the three countries on {Chen} [1197] \\'s African itinerary .Instead , agricultural and economic assistance constitute the mainstays of {our} [1139] diplomatic ties with these countries .Taiwanese agricultural specialists stationed in {Burkina Faso} [1222] have converted 1,000 hectares of desert to arable land , while Taiwanese specialists sent to {Gambia} [1219] have {successfully transplanted tomatoes , green beans , okra , and various leafy vegetables from Taiwan} [1235]{Taiwan} [1139] and raised {them} [1235] on Gambian soil .In addition to this type of technical assistance , {Taiwan} [1139] has also assisted with various infrastructure projects .Taiwan \\'s most notable contribution to {Gambia} [1219] \\'s infrastructure is the main terminal at {the airport} [1232] .Gambian {President Yahya Jameh} [1229] declared {his} [1229] support for admission of {the ROC} [1214] to {the United Nations} [1234] , and as a gesture of goodwill declared that all holders of {ROC} [1214] passports would henceforth automatically be granted 90 - day landing visas upon arrival in {Gambia} [1219] .President {Chen} [1197]{Chen \\'s trip} [1236] yielded many positive results and generated a lot of very favorable media coverage , but {it} [1236] was not problem - free .First , as {the president} [1227] was preparing to depart {Taiwan} [1139] , the Nicaraguan foreign minister publicly called upon {the ROC} [1214]{ROC} [1214] to make good on the previous administration \\'s promise of US$ 100 million in assistance .This remark sparked controversy in {Taiwan} [1139] , where some accused the new government of pursuing the same \" checkbook diplomacy \" practiced by its predecessor .Chen {Shui - bian} [1211] responded that while {the new administration} [1237] has not made plans for any new promises of foreign aid , neither will {it} [1237] fail to honor the promises made by {its} [1237] predecessor .Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao stated that the purpose of {Chen} [1197]{Chen \\'s trip} [1236] was to consolidate {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s diplomatic ties , and to strengthen friendships by building upon the existing foundation .Tien stressed that {the president} [1227] would not sign any new foreign aid agreements .President {Chen} [1197] received a very warm welcome in {Nicaragua} [1218] , but the local press still mentioned \" checkbook diplomacy \" in reporting on the visit .The {ROC} [1214] \\'s ambassador to {Nicaragua} [1218] , {Antonio Tsai} [1238] , bluntly argued in a briefing with {Chen} [1197] that {Taiwan} [1139]{Taiwan \\'s foreign assistance to Nicaragua} [1239]{Nicaragua} [1218] was being misused .According to {Tsai} [1238] , {the assistance} [1239] has been used to build a presidential palace and a new headquarters for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .Opposition politicians charge that the aid has done nothing for everyday people , and Western nations have also been critical .A second problem connected with {the trip} [1224] was the question of who would act in {the president} [1227] \\'s stead while {he} [1197] was out of {the country} [1218] .Concern over {this issue} [1240] prompted {President Chen} [1197] to state before {his} [1197] departure that {he} [1197] would remain commander - in - chief of the military forces , and that {he} [1197] would maintain hot lines to every cabinet - level agency .The {president} [1217] said that there was no need for an acting president because {he} [1197] had taken painstaking precautions to ensure domestic political stability during {his} [1197] absence .So is {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s diplomacy a way of giving back to the international community ?Or is it checkbook diplomacy ?{Ambassador - without - portfolio Lu Yi - cheng} [1241] wrote an article in which {he} [1241] argued that foreign aid has always been universally recognized as a regular tool of diplomacy as well as a humanitarian necessity , and there is no reason why {Taiwan} [1139] should have to steer clear of {it} [1139] .He pointed out that {the world \\'s developed nations} [1234] spend an average of 0.24 % of GNP on foreign aid , as opposed to 0.17 % in {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s case .In view of {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s economic strength , argued {Lu} [1241] , {our foreign aid expenditures} [1242] need not be reduced ; in fact , {they} [1242] should even be raised somewhat .The {ROC} [1214] has been criticized a lot in recent years for pursuing checkbook diplomacy , so there was no surprise when {this issue} [1240] cropped up in connection with {the president} [1227]{the president \\'s trip} [1236] .The question of an acting president , however , has never before been a matter of concern .This situation is to some degree a reflection of the fact that the public still has doubts about {the new administration} [1237] \\'s ability to govern .This is an important point that is worth keeping in mind .Paralympics Offer Stage for Taiwan PerformersClosing ceremonies for the 2000 Sydney Paralympics were held on October 29 .Nearly 4000 athletes from more than one hundred and twenty countries participated .This event , a manifestation of the ideal that \" the flame burns in the body , mind , and spirit of every individual , \" broke down international barriers and was an admirable example of the global village in operation .The {ROC} [1214] team took one gold , two silvers , and four bronzes , marking the first time any {Taiwan} [1139] athlete has returned from an Olympic games with a gold .Also , as part of the events , {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s Crescent Moon Dance Troupe , made up of handicapped persons , was the only foreign troupe invited by {the Australian government} [1243] to participate in the Paralympic Arts Festival .But even more important than these honors was the spirit of overcoming all obstacles and facing life with courage that shone through during the Paralympics .The just - completed Paralympics were enriched by ethnic flavorings .The opening ceremony on October 18 was in the form of a welcoming for aboriginal elders .Amidst a festive atmosphere , the athletes entered the stadium by categories - one group in wheelchairs , another on crutches , another led by guide dogs .The events at the 12 - day Paralympics were packed with spectators .The 1.1 million tickets sold show the extent to which everyone took the games seriously .The {host government} [1243] even set up a huge TV screen in Darwin , which is the port of entry for the most visitors to Australia , to broadcast the games live .The games were also a platform for the idea of the welfare state caring for disadvantaged groups , and for emphasizing how handicapped persons can break through barriers and limitations .On October 14 , {Taiwan} [1139]{Taiwan \\'s Crescent Moon Dance Company} [1244] created a sensation with {their} [1244] performance \" Standing on the Highest Peak , \" performed in traditional vests and short skirts as worn by indigenous people in {Taiwan} [1139] .After the 10 - minute performance ended , the hall was rocked by thunderous applause .The standing ovation lasted three minutes , and some people were even moved to tears .The Crescent Moon Dance Company has only been in operation for four years .Organized by a group of amputee women on a nonprofessional basis , {it} [1245] is {the world \\'s first dance troupe of its kind} [1246]{its} [1245] kind .As {its} [1245] manifesto reads : \" One with no voice may nonetheless sing .One with no wings may nonetheless soar .One with no limbs may nonetheless dance .The crescent moon and the full moon are the moon just the same , and equally beautiful . \"{The troupe} [1246] also delighted Sydney citizens with a performance at the Sydney City Hall on October 19 .In the competition , host country Australia took the most medals , including 64 golds.Among {the ROC} [1214] \\'s medals , the gold - the first ever for {Taiwan} [1139] - was won by Chiang Chih - chung .With a throw of 57.28 meters , {Chiang} [1247] shattered the world record for the javelin in the F12 visually - impaired class .Chiang , a member of the Bunun indigenous people , received a traditional hero \\'s welcome home from the Bunun of Sanmin Rural Township in Kaohsiung County .During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised {Chiang} [1247] for {his} [1247] glorious deeds .Meanwhile , the {ROC} [1214] table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time .In the wheelchair men \\'s doubles class 5 event , {Chou Chang - sheng} [1248] and Lin Yen - hung took the silver , while {Chou} [1248] won another silver in the men \\'s singles .The men \\'s class 9 team for persons with non-leg - related disabilities and the women \\'s wheelchair team of combined classes 4 and 5 took bronzes in team events , while Li Ching - chung -LRB- men \\'s judo class 1 -RRB- and Lu Li - hua -LRB- women \\'s powerlifting class 1 -RRB- garnered individual bronzes .Among Asian countries , {South Korea} [1249] turned in the best performance , taking five gold medals .This was due in part to the fact that {the ROK government} [1249] has provided special coaching in wheelchair table tennis to soldiers injured in service .Indeed , many handicapped competitors from other nations besides the ROK were retired veterans .Their {pensions} [1250] allow {them} [1250] free time to train , and through athletics {they} [1250] bring meaning to {their} [1250] lives and glory to {their} [1250] countries .Taiwan team members , on the other hand , come from a variety of backgrounds , and train out of personal interest .They must give up working if {they} [1250] wish to train full - time .The South Korean team of veterans , by overcoming {their} [1250] injuries to give a display of athleticism at the international level , have emerged from the shadow of war and transformed {their} [1250] handicaps into glorious results .This example should provide food for thought to the disabled and sports communities in the future .Pali : Storied Past , Uncertain Future-LRB- Lin I - hsien / photos by Diago Chiu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-I wonder if {Pali} [1251] is jealous of {Tanshui} [1252] .I ask because fate has treated these two towns , separated only by the mouth of the Tanshui River , very differently .Tanshui is celebrated in poems , songs , paintings , and lovers \\' memories of its scenic views .Pali has donuts , mussels , a garbage landfill , and troubles which have yet to be revealed to {the outside world} [1253] .Have you heard this legend ?Liao Tianding , {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s Robin Hood , fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in {Pali} [1251] , where {he} [1254] fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age 27 , was murdered in the Monkey Cave at Laochienkeng -LRB- in Pali Rural Township -RRB- by one of {his} [1254] best friends .Countless legends grew up around {Liao} [1255] after {his} [1255] death , and {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] began to worship {his} [1255] spirit .In 1958 , {his} [1255] small burial plot was converted into {a huge temple} [1257] .He has followers scattered far and wide , and every year on the special day appointed for making offerings at {his} [1255]{his temple} [1257] -LRB- the 26th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar -RRB- , the grounds are packed with cars and visitors .The {Ko} [1255]{Ko brothers} [1258] , now in {their} [1258] 60s , recall {their} [1258] impressions of a visit to the Liao Tianding gravesite : \" {It} [1259] must have been 30 years ago , {we} [1260] used to go there just for the fun of {it} [1259] .The road in front of {the temple} [1257] was n\\'t so wide then , and what a crowd !{People} [1261] were so jammed in you could n\\'t move . \"{They} [1261] also recall that the Pali of those days was a place in which most people lived by fishing , farming , or petty trading .The {elder Ko} [1255] gives a thumbs - up and declares : \" That \\'s why I always say that {a can - do guy like Liao Tianding} [1262] must be looking after {us} [1260] , so that {we} [1260] have developed and can even earn money from the tourists . \"Yet , {he} [1262] may not know about {Pali} [1251] \\'s real heyday , long in the past .The days of the sailing shipsPali was originally called Palifen , a transliteration of the place name used by the Ketagalan indigenous people .Located on the {northwest} [1263] corner of {Taiwan} [1139] , {Pali} [1251] faces the Taiwan Strait to {the northwest} [1263] , rests against Mt. Kuanyin to the southeast , and looks across the river toward Tanshui to the northeast .Though {it} [1264] does n\\'t have much of a hinterland , {its} [1264] geographic location has proved historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the Ta - pen - keng and Shih - san - hang archeological sites .Later , when {Han Chinese} [1265] began trickling across to {Taiwan} [1139] , {they} [1265] mainly settled along rivers .Because {Pali} [1251] is relatively close to {the mainland} [1266] and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that {it} [1267] does not have a natural harbor , in 1757 the Qing court designated {it} [1267] to be one of {Taiwan} [1139] \\'s small number of official ports for maritime transport with {the mainland} [1266] .Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of {Pali} [1251] .However , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in 1796 , {Pali} [1251] began to give way in importance to {Tanshui} [1252] , located just across the river .Once mainly dependent on fishing , {Pali} [1251] increasingly came to rely on farming .But the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .While {the hardy people of Pali} [1268]{Pali} [1251] barely kept {their} [1268] stomachs filled , {their} [1268] children and grandchildren left in search of a better life .Neither the Japanese occupation -LRB- which began in 1895 -RRB- nor the return to Chinese rule -LRB- in 1945 -RRB- brought much joy or change to this rural area .But in the 1970s , urban planning came to {Pali} [1251] .It proved to be the prelude to a symphony -LRB- or perhaps cacophony -RRB- of transformation .Changing the rhythm of {Pali} [1251] lifeDuring the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in {Taipei} [1269] , builders put up self - described \" villas \" and \" mansions \" -LRB- apartment blocks , in fact -RRB- one after another in {Pali} [1251] .Also , to try to reduce the outflow of population from {Pali} [1251] and to get the stagnant local economy moving , {the government} [1249] decided to link this formerly isolated village to {the outside world} [1253] .What had been Chungshan Road was turned into Provincial Highway #15 , and the opening of the Kuantu Bridge to traffic linked {Pali} [1251] directly to the busy {Taipei} [1269] districts of Shilin and Peitou .Gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , {Pali} [1251] began to dream of a tourism boom .But fortune had other things in store .In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of {Pali} [1251] , {the plan to develop tourism in Pali} [1270]{Pali} [1251] was scrapped overnight .The government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility .Then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western {Taiwan} [1139] for construction purposes , and {a harbor} [1271] was built on the Pali coast for the convenience of gravel transporters .In accordance with {the urban plan} [1272] , new streets were cut this way and that through Pali \\'s land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways .The sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .In 1997 , {the Hsiachuotzu garbage landfill} [1273] formally opened , and {it} [1273] became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of {Pali} [1251] .This rural township , which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in {Taipei County} [1274] , seemed resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered by many outlying areas -RRB- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others .It is only recently that the residents of Hsiachuotsu , unable to stand the smell , have begun to protest .Lin Yi - hung , born and raised in {Pali} [1251] , stands on the roof of {his} [1275] house and looks across to the beach where {he} [1275] used to run and play {as a child} [1276] .He can not help but sigh , {as} [1276] {he} [1275] looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that have come to this area : \" These construction projects have destroyed the relationship we people of {Pali} [1251] used to have with {the sea} [1277] . \"It \\'s certainly true that {a lot of people here} [1278] thought {they} [1278] would get rich from the rezoning .But just because {land increases in value} [1279] does n\\'t mean someone will buy {it} [1279] , and just because apartment complexes are built does n\\'t mean there are people who want to live there .Worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned in the struggle over divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money is involved .Lin concludes : \" I am not by any means opposed to development .But development is not necessarily the same as progress .Can {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] really survive change of this magnitude ? \"All part of {the plan} [1272] ?One after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of Pali residents .But so far the only things {Pali} [1251] folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an \" otherworldly \" kind .The new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious to escape from Taipei City and return to nature .But at the same time , verdant Mt. Kuanyin - named for its uncanny resemblance to the deity Kuanyin - is covered with columbariums and cemeteries .Even {Kuanyin} [1280] , worshipped for {her} [1280] limitless compassion and mercy , must be creasing {her} [1280] brow at this rampant overuse of {the mountain} [1281] .Chen {Chien - kuo , a secretary in the Pali Rural Township government} [1282]{the Pali Rural Township government} [1283] , says facetiously : \" What can {we} [1283] do ? {We} [1283] have the mountains behind {us} [1283]{us and} [1284] the sea in front .People say the fengshui is good here , so {they} [1284] come . \"{He} [1282] adds , in a far less amused tone , that {the government} [1249] has been talking about making Mt. Kuanyin a national park for a long time , and has banned construction or use of {the mountain} [1281] .But after 30 years , {the park plan} [1270] is still a non-starter , and meanwhile many cemeteries and colum - bariums have \" snuck in . \"\" Nobody seems to care about {our Pali} [1251]{our} [1285] {Pali} [1251] , and {we} [1285] are very remote , so {people} [1286] just dump what {they} [1286] do n\\'t want out here .We say that this is why {we} [1285] not only have a water pollution treatment plant and a garbage landfill , but also five nursing homes and hospices for the terminally ill . \"Take the Taipei Happy Mountain Colony for example .This venerable institution was first used to house leprosy victims , who met only fear and loathing elsewhere .In 1932 , a British missionary founded this home - over the strong opposition of the local gentry - to offer leprosy victims a place to live in dignity and find warmth away from the cold outside world .Today , {Happy Mountain} [1281] is a home for physically and mentally challenged young people , and the simple old structure , surrounded by greenery , rings with the laughter of children .Li Li - chuan , who works at {Happy Mountain} [1281] , was born and raised right here in {Pali} [1251] .Her family home is not far from the chil - dren \\'s home .\" When I was small I used to come here to play .All {the adults} [1287] called the kids \\' empty - headed . \\'I was small , and did n\\'t know any better , so I just called {them} [1287] that too . \"Stroking the head of a sleeping child with {hydrocephalus} [1288] , {she} [1288] says : \" {He} [1289] is so cute when {he} [1289] smiles ! \"Located on the margins of the island of {Taiwan} [1139] , {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] take it in stride that {they} [1256] must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast off by society - waste water , trash , the deceased , and victims of diseases that society would prefer not to see at all .And there is no sign this situation will end : Reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved to Linkou for a land reclamation project there will be trucked along Provincial Highway #15 - right through the heart of {Pali} [1251] .Serving Greater Taipei\" I believe , \" says Lin Yi - hung , \" that {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] understand that this is just the way society works -the interests of the few are sacrificed so that the majority can be better off . \"Thus , in urban plans {Pali} [1251] is always assigned the role of serving {Taipei} [1269] .\" But {the government} [1249] should think carefully about whether {they} [1249] are using the right methods or not .There are no real comprehensive policies , just short - term trade - offs of interests .There are a lot of great - sounding plans , but what do {the people of Pali} [1256]{Pali} [1251] get out of {them} [1256] ?It \\'s like the port {they} [1256] built for transporting gravel .There are a lot of bright promises for the future , raising people \\'s hopes , but who knows what the final result will really be ?
