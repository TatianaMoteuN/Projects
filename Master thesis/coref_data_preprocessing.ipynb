received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .',\n","  'It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .',\n","  'Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .',\n","  'Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households .',\n","  'I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .',\n","  'Uh-huh .',\n","  'Uh-huh .'],\n"," ['Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .',\n","  'Yes .',\n","  'I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .',\n","  'For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .',\n","  'Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .',\n","  'This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .',\n","  'It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .',\n","  'Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .',\n","  'The critical thing is --',\n","  'But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .',\n","  'Yes .',\n","  'Yes .',\n","  \"Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .\",\n","  'Right .',\n","  'It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .'],\n"," ['Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .',\n","  'Yes .',\n","  'Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .',\n","  'It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing .',\n","  'Well , Beijing Traffic Radio Station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .',\n","  'Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .',\n","  'Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .',\n","  'Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening .',\n","  'Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .',\n","  'Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .',\n","  'It was not clear , it was very congested .',\n","  'You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .',\n","  'You could find out other news only by telephone .',\n","  'The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .',\n","  'Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .',\n","  'From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .',\n","  'Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .',\n","  'Yes .',\n","  'It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .'],\n"," ['Ah , apart from this , Professor Zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?',\n","  'Right , I think this gave us many revelations , ah .',\n","  'First , I think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts .',\n","  'This is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .',\n","  'Early warnings and forecasts .',\n","  'Yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .',\n","  'Uh-huh .',\n","  'It is not only for , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .',\n","  'Uh-huh .',\n","  'That is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .',\n","  'Uh-huh .',\n","  'In this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .',\n","  'Uh-huh .',\n","  'Another thing I want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , I think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident , responsibility system .',\n","  'In fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .',\n","  'For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .',\n","  'We have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .',\n","  'That is to say , we have many corresponding systems .',\n","  'However , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .',\n","  'Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .'],\n"," ['Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?',\n","  'I think , in comparison to China , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread .',\n","  'Their level of development is more advanced than ours .',\n","  'Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .',\n","  'For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .',\n","  'With a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?',\n","  'How can a safe , assured system be established ?',\n","  'Well , we need to learn and manage this .',\n","  'Uh-huh .',\n","  'For instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .',\n","  'However , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .',\n","  'Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .',\n","  'Well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?',\n","  \"We know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test .\",\n","  'Well , how will they undergo testing ?',\n","  'These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .',\n","  'So , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , I think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .',\n","  'That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .',\n","  'How can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?',\n","  'The State Council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called One Plan , Three Systems .',\n","  'Uh-huh .',\n","  '\" One plan \" refers to the contingency plan , and \" three systems \" refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .',\n","  'So , I think we still have a lot of work to do in these three areas of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .'],\n"," ['Yes .',\n","  \"Well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in Beijing .\",\n","  'Traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now .',\n","  'Well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .',\n","  'Well , Yang Yang , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?',\n","  'I think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes .',\n","  'This is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .',\n","  'Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .',\n","  'Uh-huh .',\n","  'This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .',\n","  'There is also an issue with many of the pipes below .',\n","  'Yes , the pipes below .',\n","  'Right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --',\n","  'Moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .',\n","  'Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster , has already been added .',\n","  'But in the end , it requires time .',\n","  'Hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .',\n","  'Just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline .',\n","  'The first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .',\n","  'Yes .',\n","  'In addition , waste discharge is also very important .',\n","  'Waste discharged has currently blocked this up .',\n","  'Um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah .',\n","  'Er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television .',\n","  'Yes .',\n","  'At present , we should not have a problem with watching television .',\n","  'They are not broken .',\n","  'It is just that , as the other pipes have to be repaired , the optical fibers have to be rearranged , to be hung up it seems .',\n","  'After that , or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it safer to walk across this section .',\n","  \"Furthermore , let 's take water pipes as an example .\",\n","  'Because they were exposed , The water pipes were not --',\n","  'after that , yes , these were not damaged .',\n","  'they were not damaged and this is quite normal .',\n","  'Um , there is no problem with water supply .',\n","  'Okay , well , today both of you have come to the studio and given us

if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods .\\', \\'Well , we could not imagine

drive .\\', \\'Right .\\', \\'Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative .\\', \\'For instance , this evening , we , received an SMS .\\', \\'A friend said , I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge , ah .\\', \\'We were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .\\', \\'Later on

report titled \" Concern for Left - behind Children \" had drawn wide public attention .\\', \\'While the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question , the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public .\\', \\'Ye Jingzhong is the assistant dean of the College of Humanities and Development at China Agricultural University , and team leader of the Left - behind Children Task Force .\\', \\'In the last two years , he has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western China , including Shaanxi , Ningxia , Hebei , and Beijing .\\', \\'Why did you pick the central and western parts of China , and not the south , to conduct this study ?\\', \\'First of all , for people who work in the city from the central and western regions um , uh , according to their educational level , they generally engage in strenuous manual labor when they leave for the city to work .\\', \\'They are not in a position to bring their children to the city .\\', \\'When we conducted this research study , our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents , work in the city .\\', \\', its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents .\\', \"Therefore , we believe that whether it \\'s in southern or northern part , no matter which part of the country the research is conducted in , the results should be consistent .\", \\'According to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in China now ?\\', \\'This group should be the biggest in number .\\', \\'Um , the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million .\\', \\'Nowadays , um , , um , many places , um , cite a figure of 120 million .\\', \\'Many people quote a figure of 150 million .\\', \"Let \\'s think about it this way .\", \\'If we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city , , at least half of them are um , married before they work in the city .\\', \\'Of course , families of these married people will usually have children .\\', \\'Moreover , they will usually have more than one child in rural areas .\\', \\'So you can imagine .\\', \\'I believe the left - behind children group is definitely more than 10 or 20 million .\\', \\'It , uh , , in my opinion , should be around 50 million .\\', \\'Of course , we have not conducted exact statistical calculations .\\', \\'I believe the number of this group should be particularly large .\\', \\'According to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody . Among which , single - parent custody had the highest number , accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed .\\', \\'The next one was skip - generation custody , accounting for 16.9 percent .

impacts on their life .\\', \\'No doubt , , single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types .\\', \\'The impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home .\\', \"There is no major problem in the children \\'s material life .\", \\'Of course , there are many impacts in other aspects , for instance , peer socialization .\\', \\'The one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody .\\', \\'Skip - generation custody means the grandparents look after the children .\\', \\'There is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children , and there is a type called self - custody .\\', \\'These three types create the biggest and the most impact .\\', \"If we want to discuss this in more detail , let \\'s say , the skip - generation custody .\", \\'First , in skip - generation custody , their material life will no doubt be a lot less taken care of when compared to the usual both parents or one parent at home situation .\\', \\'This is indisputable .\\', \\'This type of family is not as good as the others .\\', \\'We had an example of a child in Shaanxi province .\\', \\'Um , there was a family !\\', \\'This family had an older brother and a younger sister .\\', \\'Both parents wanted to go to the city to work .\\', \\'The father went first , and later the mother wanted to go , too .\\', \\'What happened to these two children ?\\', \\'The grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas , grandparents also have to work in the field !\\', \\'As a result , , this mother sent , these brother and sister , to martial arts school to study .\\', \\'After they went to the martial arts school for a while , um , their mother was , um , a little worried , so she went to visit them .\\', \\'She went to visit them .\\', \\'When she saw them , , the girl cried to her and said , \" I really do n\\\\\\'t want to stay here .\\', \\'I want to go home . \"\\', \\'Later , the mother was moved and brought , this girl home and had the grandparents look after her .\\', \\'Um , she still , ai , left him at the martial arts school .\\', \\'Um , um , after the girl returned , the mother continued to work in the city .\\', \"When she came back one time in between work , she found that the girl \\'s body was dotted with red marks and red swellings .\", \\'She then discovered ah , um , the grandparents had not washed her clothes for a very long time .\\', \\'The situation you mentioned , is it common or is it a rather extreme example , because generally , people will think that grandparents will particularly love and care about their grandchildren ?\\', \\'The situation that I just mentioned regarding skip - generation custody is no doubt common .\\', \\'Why is it so ?\\', \\'You said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .\\', \\'It is true .\\', \\'It is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children .\\', \\'However , for the elderly , with the difference in age and time , , their , ways of taking care and loving the children are different .\\', \\'They are influenced by their own habits .\\', \\'For instance , there was a child who was sick .\\', \\'Um , the grandparents asked him to take , a small pill that was made in Shaanxi .\\', \\'They did not even know what it was made of .\\', \\'It was a local method .\\', \\'Um , after all , they are different from , um , young people in this respect .\\', \\'Instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible , they are influenced by , some habits in this aspect .\\', \\', they raised this point themselves .\\', \\'Another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family .\\', \\'\" Her father and mother are not home , so the entire family falls onto our shoulders , especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland .\\', \\'So , all I can do is to feed her and make sure that she is not cold . \"\\', \\'They also had to face such a reality , one that they could not resolve .\\', \\'After all , a family that had

resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .', 'How many groups of people will be sent ?', 'Many groups .', 'Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .', 'It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .', 'Uh-huh .', 'How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?', 'Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .', 'For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .', 'However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .', 'Hence , I think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .', 'Uh-huh .', 'It was a very successful , er , response .', 'I think many good things can be summed up from this .', 'Yes .', \"Yang Yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?\", 'For instance , it is very cold during winter in Beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .', 'Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .', 'Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing .', 'Well , , in this regard , the Chaoyang district government did a very good job .', 'After it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .', 'It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .', 'Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .', 'Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households .', 'I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .', 'Uh-huh .', 'Uh-huh .']\n","\n","['Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .', 'Yes .', 'I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .', 'For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .', 'Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .', 'This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .', 'It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .', 'Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .', 'The critical thing is --', 'But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .', 'Yes .', 'Yes .', \"Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .\", 'Right .', 'It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .']\n","\n","['Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .', 'Yes .', 'Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .', 'It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part

vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .', 'Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .',

various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .', 'Early warnings and forecasts .', 'Yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .', 'Uh-huh .', 'It is not only for , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .', 'Uh-huh .', 'That is , this

evolving into a sudden public emergency .', 'Uh-huh .', 'Another thing I want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , I think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident , responsibility system .', 'In fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .', 'For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .', 'We have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .', 'That is to say , we have many corresponding systems .', 'However , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .', 'Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .']\n","\n","['Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?', 'I think , in comparison to China , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread .', 'Their level of development is more advanced than ours .', 'Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .', 'For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .', 'With a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?', 'How can a safe , assured system be established ?', 'Well , we need to learn and manage this .', 'Uh-huh .', 'For instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .', 'However , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .', 'Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .', 'Well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?', \"We know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test .\", 'Well , how will they undergo testing ?', 'These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .', 'So , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , I think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .', 'That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .', 'How can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?', 'The State Council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called One Plan , Three Systems .', 'Uh-huh .', '\" One plan \" refers to the contingency plan , and \" three systems \" refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms ,

think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes .', 'This is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .', 'Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .', 'Uh-huh .', 'This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .',

pouring concrete and then --', 'Moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .', 'Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster , has already been added .', 'But in the end

We respectfully invite you to watch a special edition of Across China . WW II Landmarks on the Great Earth of China : Eternal Memories of Taihang Mountain' Standing tall on Taihang Mountain is the Monument to the Hundred Regiments Offensive . It is composed of a primary stele , secondary steles , a huge round sculpture and beacon tower , and the Great Wall , among other things . A primary stele , three secondary steles , and two inscribed steles . The Hundred Regiments Offensive was the campaign of the largest scale launched by the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance against Japan . This campaign broke through the Japanese army 's blockade to reach base areas behind enemy lines , stirring up anti-Japanese spirit throughout the nation and influencing the situation of the anti-fascist war of the people worldwide . This is Zhuanbi Village , Wuxiang County of Shanxi Province , where the Eighth Route Army was headquartered back then . On a wall outside the headquarters we found a map . This map was the Eighth Route Army 's depiction of the Mediterranean Sea situation at that time . This map reflected the European battlefield situation .In 1940 , the German army invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia , Poland , the Netherlands , Belgium , and France . It was during this year that the Japanese army developed a strategy to rapidly force the Chinese people into submission by the end of 1940 . In May , the Japanese army launched -- From one side , it seized an important city in China called Yichang . Um , , uh , through Yichang , it could directly reach Chongqing . Ah , that threatened Chongqing . Then they would , ah , bomb these large rear areas such as Chongqing . So , along with the coordinated , er , economic blockade , military offensives , and strategic bombings , er , a simultaneous attack was launched in Hong Kong to lure the KMT government into surrender . The progress of this coordinated offensive was already very entrenched by then . \n","\n","By 1940 , China 's War of Resistance against Japan had entered a stalemate . The situation on our side and the enemy 's side was intertwined . The Eighth Route Army guerrillas were extraordinarily active , creating more and more trouble for the Japanese army in North China . Hayao Tada , commander of the Japanese North China Area Army , adopted a strategy of siege warfare to deal with the Eighth Route Army . The specific method was building a closely connected transport network , with a road for every village and defensive towers on every road . Roads and railways were used as links to connect all of North China into a solid , widespread siege , in order to strangle the Eighth Route Army and its base areas in this net . As part of the Japanese army 's strategy of siege warfare , railways and roads had actually become the Japanese army 's weapons of war , becoming a great threat to the base areas . In December 1939 , Commander - in - chief Zhu De and Vice Commander Peng Dehuai of the Eighth Route Army received a top - secret telegram from Commander Lu Zhengcao of the Jizhong Military District , among other people . The telegram said that the Japanese troops were building blockade trenches and chessboard - like roads to divide the Jizhong base area into small isolated blocks without the ability to mutually communicate and support each other , causing the Eighth Route Army and the guerrillas to lose maneuverability . Before the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940 , an inclination to compromise , ah , surrender , was an extremely serious crisis in the frontline situation in China . Well , on the battlefield behind enemy lines , in order to take over , consolidate the area under its occupation , Japan began a new strategy . That was to use railways as a pillar , roads as a chain , and strongholds as a lock , to carry out siege warfare in an attempt to divide the base areas behind enemy lines , ah , so as , er , to cut off their communication with one another . In addition , it relied on this cage , ah , to further strengthen its assaults against the base areas . Er . So , it was amidst such a grave international and domestic situation that the Eighth Route Army led by the Chinese Communist Party , ah , launched , ah , a strategic offensive called the Hundred Regiments Offensive . This plot of the Japanese army drew great attention from Zhu De and Peng Dehuai of Eighth Route Army headquarters . After meticulous studies and painstaking preparations by many parties , a battle plan based on surprise was formulated . On July 22 , 1940 , a campaign preparation order to attack the Zhengtai Railway , jointly signed by Zhu De , Peng Dehuai , and Zuo Quan , was sent to Yan'an and all units of the Eighth Route Army . What was the , purpose and goal of this campaign ? It was to break through the Japanese army 's siege policy against base areas behind enemy lines , and to avert the crisis of China 's compromise and surrender . It was to overcome this crisis . Well , the Hundred Regiments Offensive was divided into three phases . Beginning from August 20 , from August 20 to September 10 , the main purpose of the campaign was to sabotage the Zhengtai Railway .\n","\n","The Zhengtai Railway started from Zhengding , Hebei in the east and ended in Taiyuan in the west , with a total length of 243 kilometers traversing the Taihang Mountain range . During the War of Resistance against Japan , the Zhengtai Railway was a key strategic transportation line for the Japanese army in North China . It was also one of the major blockade lines for causing destruction to anti-Japanese base areas . Along this railway line was the Niangziguan Pass , a natural barrier , and the Jingjing coalmine , a key fuel base in Yangquan for the Japanese military in North China . Outside of Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang , the Japanese military deployed the 4th , 8th , and 93rd mixed brigades and regiments , which were scattered among 50 strongholds along the railway line . The situation was getting worse and worse for the Eighth Route Army and the anti-Japanese areas behind enemy lines . Actions had to be taken to break through the blockade . On a night in late July 1940 , the atmosphere in Zhuanbi Village in Shaanxi was unusual . Villager Xiao Jianghe has a vivid memory of this piece of history . On that dark night , everyone was sleeping when human voices and neighing horses were heard within the village . People all got up . Did something happen ? Some folks got up . Opening the street gate , they saw a soldier standing by the gate . Folks , go back , go back , nothing is wrong . Our troops are just going to stay here for the night . Do n't say you are scared . Our commander is coming . I am telling you to go back to sleep peacefully . Ah , so we went back to sleep . Ah , why should you come out if you were told not to ? By the time we got up early the following morning , the sports ground in Zhuanbi Village was packed with soldiers who had stationed there . Essentially the entire enemy had been destroyed . It was an arduous battle . At 10:00 p.m. on August 20 , 1940 , various units of the Eighth Route Army launched a full - scale offensive according to the general plan . The head of the County People 's Armed Forces Commission was named Zhao Yemin . Zhao Yemin came , ah , bringing a group of armed personnel and some things . Upon arriving , he relayed an order , saying the road from Yangquan to Hedi must be cut off tonight , with the electrical wires slashed . He himself would bring , this group of people to blow up that Wudu bridge . Led by Nie Rongzhen , the Shanxi - Chahar - Hebei Military District was ready for an offensive , while at the same time , fifteen regiments laid an ambush in advance along the Zhengtai Railway , launching fierce attacks on Japanese military strongholds along the railway line . It was also during the night of August 20 that the 129th Division directed by Division Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping , with eight regiments , including two regiments of the 1st Dare - to - Die Corps and eight independent battalions , formed left - flank and right - flank commandos and a central contingent . On the night of August 20 , offensives were launched against most of the Japanese independent 4th mixed brigade and part of the independent 9th mixed brigade along the western section of the Zhengtai Railway . Additionally , two regiments , together with local armed forces in places such as Pingding , Liaoxian , and Yushe , carried out sabotage on the Pingliao and Yuliao roads and pinned down the enemy at various points , ensuring safety of the main forces on the sides and rear . Current estimates are that this section was taken care of in less than four hours , three hours . After this was taken care of , four blockhouses were blown up . By digging tunnels , they charged out the center . Only then did they , wipe out the enemy . More than two hundred enemy soldiers were eliminated in a single blow . It was still during this night that the 120th Division , directed by Division Commander He Long and Political Commissar Guan Xiangying , with 20 regiments , sabotaged the northern section of the Tongpu Railway and some main roads west of the railway . It also took over strongholds at Yangfangkou , Kangjiahui , and Fengrui Village , cutting off the northern section of the Tongpu railway and the roads from Xinxian to Jingle and Fenyang . In order to coordinate with breakthrough battles at the Zhengtai Railway and the northern section of the Tongpu Railway , the 129th Division and the Shanxi - Chahar - Hebei Military District also ordered their units to deploy more than 50 regiments Yang to Lishi in cooperation with militias , to launch widespread sabotage and raids on the Pinghan , Pingsui , Beining , Baijin , Jinpu , and Deshi railway lines , among others , as well as some main roads and many strongholds occupied by the Japanese army .\n","\n","On the afternoon of August 22 , Peng Dehuai was listening to the combat operation director report on battle developments at Eighth Route Army operational headquarters . When asked about the actual combat strength of the Eighth Route Army , the combat operation director reported : There are 30 regiments along the Zhengtai Line , 15 regiments along the Lugou Bridge - Handan section of the Pinghan line , 12 regiments along the Datong - Hongdong section in Tonghu County , and four regiments along the Tianjin - Dezhou section of the Jinpu Line , with a total of 105 regiments entering the campaign . With a wave of his hand , Peng Dehuai said that despite being over 100 regiments , let 's call this campaign the Hundred Regiments Offensive . That afternoon , Peng Dehuai first used the name Hundred Regiments Offensive in telegrams sent to various military corps and the Central Military Commission . A total of 105 regiments participated in the Hundred Regiments Offensive . Well , it was a force of more than 200,000 soldiers . In addition to that , er , no less than 400,000 militiamen , guerrillas , and civilians , er , voluntarily participated in the offensive . So , there were probably 600,000 - plus soldiers and civilians . The Hundred Regiments Offensive dealt a devastating blow to the enemy at Shi'nao Mountain . Our troops were strong , troops were strong . Er , and those in charge of logistics and support were able to follow in time . Er , , er , the anti-Japanese vanguard team was composed of all young people in their 20s ; all young people , all in their , 20s .\n","\n","This is Shi'nao Mountain , situated in Yangquan , Shanxi , a strategic passage of the Zhengtai Railway back then . On August 21 , 1940 , in order to pin down Japanese troops stationed in Yangquan and to cover for militiamen sabotaging the western section of the Zhengtai Railway , the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army ordered the main regiment of its 385th Brigade , the 14th Regiment led by Brigade Commander Chen Xilian , to head directly for Shi'nao Mountain to seize the high ground . Like a sharp sword , civilians in the western section broke through the strategic passage . Frustrated and angry , the Japanese army immediately deployed a large number of troops in an attempt to retake Shi'nao Mountain  . To the enemy 's complete surprise , desolate Shi'nao Mountain had been turned into a strong combat fortress by our troops in less than a night . Like a lion with its mouth wide open , towering and rugged Shi'nao Mountain was constantly waiting for any invaders who dared come close . The night before , we destroyed the roads and cut off all electrical and railway lines , making it impossible for it to communicate . It did not know how many of us went to destroy the roads , whether it was the Eighth Route Army or not , the regulars , or others  .It did not know , right ? After all , its telephones had stopped working . Yeah , the roads had been cut off , with its vehicles unable to drive back and forth . The following seven days and nights were extremely tough . Starting from the 23rd , the Japanese army in Yangquan , backed by helicopters , launched nonstop fierce attacks on Shi'nao Mountain using chemical weapons . During the Shi'nao Mountain battle , our soldiers died in large numbers . So many died that the clean - up was done in batches . In addition , many people were poisoned when toxic gas was released . They were poisoned and did not know how to protect themselves against the poison . They simply crawled on the ground and wetted handkerchiefs in the rain to cover their noses against the poison . Eh , medics were quite busy . Several days of autumn rain turned the combat trenches extremely muddy . The Eighth Route Army officers and soldiers soaking in the muddy water fought their powerful enemy with utmost effort . With bombs exploding next to the trenches , they showed no fear at all . When their blood turned the yellow soil red , they applied iodine solution to their wounds and closed them with bandages . They wrapped them with bandages , and that was it .vUnder the powerful offensive of the Eighth Route Army , the enemy was only able to defend itself , without any strength to fight back . The battle proceeded very smoothly , with the initiative steadily in the grasp of the Eighth Route Army .\n","\n","Since the strategic objective of the Hundred Regiments Offensive was to smash the enemy 's blockade of bases , it was of critical importance to destroy the roads and remove strongholds . The various units of the Eighth Route Army taking part in the battle wasted no time destroying the roads . They proposed not to leave behind a single rail , a single cross tie , a single railway station , a single blockhouse , a single bridge , or a single electricity pole . They mobilized and organized the masses and won over the railway staff , making great effort to destroy the railroad , the stations , and related facilities by means including dismantlement , explosion , fire , and water . I was in charge of this , er , and -- Er , er , due to this -- To cut off the electricity , er , considered a deputy commander - in - chief responsible for these electricity lines .  I was responsible for this project , ah . The militiamen were divided into two groups . One was responsible only for cutting electrical wires , and the other for destroying roads . We people , ah , were under his command for the time being . We all took part in destroying roads . From the Zhengtai road , from , um , Zhengding to , um , Shijiazhuang , to Taiyuan , more than 400,000 civilians participated in destroying roads . Most important at that time along the Zhengtai road was mainly to destroy the Jinxi coal mine . Soldiers used hay cutters to sever the wire net , charging into the station and destroying the machine room and water tower , and then started to destroy the road . Of the three to four thousand civilians participating in the battle , one soldier was added to every squad of 16 people formed . While destroying roads , there was clear - cut division of labor . Some took off screws ; some uprooted rail spikes ; some knocked off joint bars ; some removed cross ties ; some carried away rails . For cutting electrical wires , the militiamen in the village were waiting for the troops to come ,Ah , Over there , a builder of the surrounding walls sabotaged transportation by pushing over his surrounding walls . It was built during the day , and at night , overnight militiamen shoveled it over . The task of the 72nd Regiment was , er , this destruction battle . This destruction battle went on for a day and a night . Each day the general situation was different . -LSB- -LSB- They attacked small bridges and small districts , and generally looted these stations . -RSB- -RSB- They carried away the iron , the iron rails of the railway , er to make steel . Er , for wood materials , local folks simply destroyed them by fire . In this way , they fought the battle while at the same time destroying roads , stripping the entire 60 - li - long railway from Xingtai to Neiqiu within just a few days . In this way , a blockade line of steel regarded as a lifeline by the Japanese army was paralyzed . It was a very tough battle . The enemy attacked several times , and each time they were repelled . There were extremely heavy casualties . Overseas Japanese in Yangquan City were all mobilized to participate in the battle , including children of 15 to 16 years of age . They wanted to have , overseas compatriots get together so that they could support one another in wiping out the Eighth Route Army and foiling our movement to destroy roads .\n","\n","The Hundred Regiments Offensive lasted three and a half months and involved two major offensive phrases and one anti-sweep phase . During the first phase from August 20 to September 10 , 1940 , a general offensive was launched on major transportation lines such as the Zhengtai , Tongpu , Pinghai , and Jinfu lines with an emphasis on destroying the Zhengtai Railway . During the second phase from September 22 to early October , the mission was to continue expanding battle achievements , to destroy the flanks of transportation lines , and to penetrate puppet strongholds in anti-Japanese bases .During the third phrase from October 6 to December 4 , the main task was to counterattack a retaliatory sweep by the Japanese army and puppet army . The Eighth Route Army smashed successive large - scale sweep operations launched by the Japanese army and puppet army against anti-Japanese bases in Taihang , Taiyue , Pingxi , Beiyue , and northwest areas of Shanxi , among others . To those who have never experienced wars , wars are vivid stories . To those who have experienced wars , war is the course of life , part of life . There are , At that time , the Hundred Regiments Offensive greatly encouraged the vast numbers of soldiers and civilians , with news of fighting spreading rapidly throughout the Taihang Mountain area . \n","\n","Few of the veterans who participated in the Hundred Regiments Offensive are still alive . When they speak of the Hundred Regiments Offensive , they are always so excited . Everyone has their own memory , has the Hundred Regiments Offensive as their own memory ; er , I got five bullets . I carried these five bullets with me in my pocket . I took them out for a look every day . Hey , this was my life . Hey , this was my life . I could not lose them . The squad leader said , at the time when you are given a rifle , you need to shoot . I will watch . If you fail to shoot the enemy , I will punish you when you come back . Do you know lice ? They bite . How do you scald them ? Hey  Well , you boil some water and get something like gunpowder .', 'Then you loosen your pants and sprinkle it . Clench it like this . Then , you shake it , and you hear a cracking sound on the ground ; hey , scalded lice . A washbasin was also very precious . How was the washbasin used ? You used the washbasin to wash your feet , used the washbasin to hold your meal , used the washbasin to wash your face , and sometimes used the same washbasin to boil water . So , this washbasin was a precious washbasin . This photo taken back then by Eighth Route Army field correspondent Xu Xiaobing is a snapshot of Peng Dehuai directing the campaign at the frontline of the Hundred Regiments Offensive . Just as Mao Zedong once praised : Who dares wield his sword and make his horse rear ? Only our great General Peng . Correspondent Xu Xiaobing , covering frontline news at the time , snapped the shutter while artillery fire roared overhead . More than 60 years later , Xu Xiaobing still vividly remembers the scene at that time . Dehuai was sitting in this trench directing the campaign . Oh . Bullets and artillery fire whistled past his head . During the three and a half months from August 20 to December 5 , 1940 , the Eighth Route Army fought a total of 1,824 battles large and small . A total of 46,480 Japanese soldiers and puppet soldiers were killed , wounded , or captured , or defected . Four hundred seventy - four kilometers of railroad and 1,502 kilometers of highway were destroyed . In addition , large quantities of other military supplies were seized or destroyed . After the Eighth Route Army launched the Hundred Regiments Offensive , newspapers from areas behind enemy lines in North China to the large rear area continuously carried news of victories . Telegrams and letters of congratulation arrived in Yan'an from all directions . Mao Zedong was deeply moved . This leader with a strong poetic temperament expressed his joy in this kind of telegram . The Hundred Regiments Offensive caused great excitement . Can such kind of campaign be organized once or twice more ? In a congratulatory telegram to Zhu De and Peng Dehuai , Chiang Kai - Shek praised the Eighth Route Army 's resolute attacks for dealing a heavy blow to the enemy . By pinning down large numbers of Japanese soldiers on battlefields behind enemy lines in North China , the Hundred Regiments Offensive delayed the Japanese army 's aggression southward . In addition , the Hundred Regiments Offensive was a response to the European battlefield , while enhancing the international reputation of the CPC and the Eighth Route Army . The Hundred Regiments Offensive wrote a glorious page in the history of China 's War of Resistance against Japan . On June 30 , 1987 , the Monument to the Hundred Regiments Offensive was erected on Shi'nao Mountain in Yangquan , Shanxi , where the heroes had fought the battle . In 1993 , six villagers in Honghecao Village set up the Hundred Regiments Offensive Museum at the place of Nie Rongzhen 's operational command . Old Li Jingtang still tells visitors old war stories circulating in the Taihong Mountain area . More than 60 years have passed since the Hundred Regiments Offensive took place . Taihang Mountain will forever remember that great battle during the Chinese people 's War of Resistance against Japan . During World War II , the two hundred thousand strong Chinese Expeditionary Force went abroad to fight . The Burma Road was the lifeline artery for China 's anti-Japanese battlefields . The Tengchong Battle , an annihilation of the Japanese army , became a typical example for the China war area . We respectfully invite you to watch a bloody battle fought side - by - side by China , the US , and Britain 60 years ago in a joint effort to repel Japanese invaders .\n","\n","Hello , everyone .

The APEC meeting is being held these days in Pusan , South Korea . Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi also arrived in Pusan this afternoon , beginning his APEC trip this time . Well , prior to this , many analysts all think that during his trip to the APEC meeting in Pusan , this time , Junichiro Koizumi may likely be isolated by various parties . The reason is that in its persistent alignment with the US , Japan has ignored its relations with other countries , especially its Asian neighboring countries . What is clearly remembered by its Asian neighboring countries is that on October 17 this year , in spite of opposition , Junichiro Koizumi stubbornly , ah , visited Yasukuni Shrine for the fifth time during the four years since he took office . Well , what kind of situation will Japan find itself in at the APEC summit ? What kind of impact will Koizumi 's lame diplomacy produce on the international image of Japan ?

Welcome you two to the studio to participate in our program . Well , we all know that Koizumi arrived in Pusan this afternoon . In the afternoon he met with South Korean President Roh Moo - hyun . The two met . Well , from the information and the situation you have learned , how would you two interpret some messages sent out by their meeting this time ? Ah , first of all , I think , ah , , this time , ah , when Koizumi arrived in Pusan , ah , he had this in his mind . That is , through multilateral meetings , he attempted to meet with , ah , leaders of South Korea or other Asian nations , Uh-huh . so as to -- Uh-huh . demonstrate that even though he visited Yasukuni Shrine , Uh-huh . his relations with neighboring countries are not affected . Uh-huh .\n","\n","However , actually , today President Roh Moo - hyun of the hosting country of the meeting , Uh-huh . well , based on his meeting with Koizumi , I think , actually , it shows that a series of issues such as his visit to Yasukuni Shrine have indeed cast a very heavy shadow over the relations between the two countries . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Yes . Well , during this meeting , er , President Roh Moo - hyun clearly pointed out , ah , what did he point out ? That is , er , the visit to Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese leaders , politicians , and statesmen , is a , , provocation , ah , to South Korea . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , at the same time , he pointed out , that is , er , the issue of the prime minister 's visit to Yasukuni Shrine , the textbook issue , and the territorial dispute . Uh-huh . All these must be properly resolved before the relations between the two countries can improve . Uh-huh . Well , Koizumi , he also , that is to say , er , argued slyly for himself , ah , he said , er , that his visit was not to glorify the war . Uh-huh . Nor was this for anything else . It was only done to express condolences on the war dead . Uh-huh . Well , at the same time , that is , it was to express that there shall be no more war in future . However , this was still not accepted by the South Korean side . Well , after the meeting between the two sides , we were very interested in this . That is , originally this year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan . fortieth anniversary . In addition , is n't this year the year of the South Korean - Japanese friendship ? Yes , yes , yes . Uh-huh . Yes , yes , the year of friendship . Uh-huh . Er , well , according to the original arrangement , that is , President Roh Moo - hyun should pay a visit to Japan , ah , at the end of this year . Uh-huh . However , this matter was not even talked about during this , eh , bilateral summit meeting . I think this shows that it is not going to happen . Right . Uh-huh .\n","\n","Some commentaries said that when Koizumi went to meet with Roh Moo - hyun this time , it was like clutching at a straw to save his life . Eh , it means that you see , although many neighboring countries are complaining about me , my image may return to a better one after I met with Roh Moo - hyun . However , based on the outcome , just as Professor Liu introduced , it was equivalent to going there to get criticized again . Right . Well , was n't it that things went contrary to his wishes ? Uh-huh , to him . that is to say , to Japan , to Prime Minister Koizumi , this is a very difficult diplomatic journey . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , to be able to meet with Roh Moo - hyun was originally the only remedy he could count on . Uh-huh . However , Roh Moo - hyun actually met with him ceremonially as a host because APEC held the meeting in South Korea . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . But , he seized the opportunity fully to express the wish of the South Korean government and people . Uh-huh . What he meant by the wish was to stop visiting Yasukuni Shrine . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , contrary to Koizumi 's diplomatic purpose , he not only failed to sidestep the issue of the visit , but rather exposed , this scandal to the entire world . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , from the bottom of his heart , he might feel it was even worse than not meeting at all . Uh-huh . So , this only hope of his was also destroyed . Uh-huh .\n","\n","We have just started with this topic of the meeting between President Roh Moo - hyun and Koizumi . Well , actually , regarding , um , Koizumi 's attendance at this APEC summit , people are more interested in the relations between Japan and its Asian neighboring countries , including the kind of alliance relationship between the US and Japan , and so on . Uh-huh . Yeah . Well , speaking of the relationship issue , we have noticed that during US President Bush 's visit in Japan , Koizumi made some declaration of this position . He said , as long as we get on good terms with the US , then it follows naturally we will have good relations with our Asian neighboring countries . Well , regarding this attitude he has adopted , well , two professors , how would you look at Koizumi 's diplomatic thinking ? Well , this is because he is still using the pre-Cold - War diplomatic thinking after the Cold War , that is , the United States is the number one superpower in the world . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Japan is the second largest economy in the world . Uh-huh . As long as these two countries stand together , then it seems that other countries could not do anything to them . Uh-huh . Well , this is actually a very overbearing image . Uh-huh .\n","\n","Well , looking at the situation in Asia , actually , it is exactly the other way round . Uh-huh . That is to say , if it does not get on good terms with its Asian neighboring countries , then in reality the US will become even more hard - line in its diplomacy with Japan . As for Japan , to the US , it furthermore has lost some assets , diplomatic assets when making negotiations with the US . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , just recently , it 's needless for us to say , er , that Japan 's relations , we can say , with its neighboring countries this year have suffered overall deterioration . These include Japan 's relations with South Korea , China , and Russia which are all deteriorating , well , even including its relations with the US . In fact , , even today , we also noticed a piece of news that although at , um , the recent two - plus - two meeting , er , the US and Japan again reached an intermediate report , Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , today , actually the head of Japan 's Defense Agency again mentioned to the US that it seems to feel regretful , why ? Uh-huh . That is , a bit regretful . Because , according to the two - plus - two intermediate report just reached , the US military bases in Japan should undergo adjustment . However , it was met with strong opposition from the general public in Japan . So it may be hard to implement . Uh-huh . So , now the JDA head came to talk with the US , saying , whether our interests can be taken into consideration again , er , in this intermediate report . That is , between the US and Japan , centering upon this intermediate report , actually the deal is again partially completed . Uh-huh . So , such a prime minister like Koizumi , who blindly follows the US as the guideline of his diplomacy , was rarely seen even during the Cold War era . Uh-huh .\n","\n","We know that in 1957 Japan had three diplomatic principles . That is to say , it must take good care of its relations with the Western countries , Asian countries , and the United Nations . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . But now , Koizumi is like a stick , let 's say , a post . Right . It takes three points to support a plane . Yeah . So , it turned out that they had such stuff on the surface . Well , some prime ministers before Koizumi at least would still properly deal with and balance the relations with America , with the US and Asia , in particular , with China , ah . Uh-huh . Well , when it comes to Koizumi , he only takes good care of the relations with the US . Right . In fact , he will surely fail to take good care of the relations with the US because if you can not win the trust of your Asian neighboring countries , the US will not fully respect such a country . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . The US also wants to go beyond Japan to keep good relations with China , South Korea , and other Asian countries . Therefore , the more he follows the US , the lower will be his actual status in Asia . Uh-huh . It is impossible . Right , his idea was actually criticized and opposed by some politicians even in Japan . He was strongly criticized and increasingly isolated . Ah . The domestic economy was also affected . Many people also mentioned , by valuing the US alone , you are ignoring Asia . Yes . Now many media all issued statements and editorials . Therefore , some people also compared this diplomacy of his to a lame diplomacy . Yeah . He --\n","\n","Could he walk steadily with a lame diplomacy ? Eh , as far as Koizumi himself is concerned , what is his problem ? Uh-huh . He himself , ah , er , what should we say ? He does not respect and acknowledge reality . Actually , some people say he is deceiving himself as well as others . Uh-huh . For instance , this time at the APEC meeting in Pusan , when he mentioned , er , Japan 's relations with China , he still used this kind of , that is to say , rhetoric , to defend himself . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . He said , er , , ah , right now , Japan - China relations are not like , er , what the international community is worried about . Uh-huh . Well , the economic trade development in our two countries is going on quite well . In fact , we can say he does not understand the current status of Sino - Japanese relations . Uh-huh . Actually , due to his visit to Yasukuni Shrine and the cooling down of the political relationship , Sino - Japanese relations have suffered severe blows . He is only indulging in his unilateral wishful thinking . It is only what he thinks . Uh-huh . We can see some concrete figures . For instance , from January to August this year , the latest statistics show that Japan 's exports to China grew only by 3.2 % according to China 's statistics . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . It grew only by 5.8 % according to Japan 's statistics . Uh-huh . Well , in previous years , it was always more than 25 % . In other words , Japan 's exports to China were declining sharply . More than 25 % . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , at the same time , with respect to Japan 's investment in China , during the first half of last year , Japan 's investment projects in China decreased by 8.2 % while the contractual amount decreased by 0.4 % . They both showed that due to the cooling down of the political relationship , well , the economic relations between China and Japan have already been severely affected . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . In addition , there has also been the impact on the feelings of peoples of the two countries . Yeah . Originally , Koizumi 's key fallacy for his visits to Yasukuni Shrine was that my visits would not affect in any way our relations with Asia . Uh-huh . It is not like that in reality . Uh-huh . Well , when Koizumi visits Yasukuni Shrine , he is betting on the national interests of Japan . That is to say , he is selling the international image and national interests of Japan at cheap prices . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So this is being paid at a heavy price . Uh-huh . Many Japanese people also see that this does not conform to Japan 's own fundamental interests , ah , as a country with so many international , um , interests . Interests . with national interests . At the same time , it also actually denigrates Japan 's image . Uh-huh .\n","\n","Well , with regard to Koizumi 's diplomatic thinking , there is still , that is , one question . Ah , people may also frequently ask such a question that since it is the most important thing for a country to keep good relationship with its neighboring countries , why would Japan want to seek far and wide for what lies close at hand ? Right . Out of what consideration is he doing this ? Well , um , this Prime Minister Koizumi , ah , first of all , personally , he is an individual with a kind of belief , a very rightist political belief . Well , it also precisely reflects a current political trend of forces surrounding the Koizumi administration . Uh-huh . It also reflects that nowadays Japan , in its eagerness to become a political power , well , wants to take advantage of the sentiments of extreme nationalism to move toward and realize this goal . For instance , they have , a kind of wrong doing . That is to say , if Japan wants to become a powerful country commanding true respect , it must get rid of the name of a defeated country , the name of an aggressor country in World War II . Uh-huh . So , they chose a very dangerous road . Uh-huh . That is to say , it tries to become a decent country by negating its history as an aggressor . This is exactly a road that leads nowhere . Uh-huh . Well , this road he takes will surely isolate Japan from the international community and will definitely not make it a political power in the end . Uh-huh . Well , he chose the wrong road . Ah , in addition , from his point of view , he is counting on his luck to a large extent . We can also say that some think tank people around him may have given him the wrong idea . Perhaps he was misled , wow . Ah . For example , regarding his visits to Yasukuni Shrine , , he says , if I , keep doing it like this , China , South Korea , ah , , that is to say , you will , grow tired of protesting . Once you see a lot of it , you will get used to it . So , you will swallow the bitterness while I keep doing like this . Uh-huh . However , it turns out to be exactly the opposite . He did not know this issue could bring big trouble to Japan . He did not know the seriousness of the issue . this is an issue of principle . Right .\n","\n","Well , we can say that an overall review of the current diplomatic status of Japan should show two clear roads . Ha , one is to follow the US blindly , which is one of its very important diplomatic lines . And we can also see the other one , that is , to continue damaging the relations with its close neighbors Well , speaking of this , we can also figure out that Koizumi has seriously damaged the feelings of his Asian neighboring countries several times since he took office as Japan 's prime minister in 2001 . We compiled a background video clip here , and let 's learn about some relevant information together . In February 2005 , just one day after Chinese people 's traditional Spring Festival , the Japanese government claimed the lighthouse set on Diaoyu Island by Japan 's extreme rightist group without permission as its national property and put in under the administration of Japan . On March 16 , 2005 , Japan 's Shimane Prefecture assembly voted to pass a measure bill concerning Takeshima Day and officially designated February 22 as Takeshima Day . As a result , this small island just a bit over 90 kilometers from Utsuryo Island , South Korea , again triggered a diplomatic conflict between the two countries . South Korea thinks that this island called Dokdo Island has always been a Korean territory . On April 1 , 2005 , the Japanese Ministry of Education approved a new edition of history textbooks compiled by the new history textbook compilation committee and published by Fusosha Publishing House and announced the result officially on April 5 . There are very few amendments in the new edition of Japanese history textbooks . The parts of the old version that twisted the history and denied its crime of aggression remained unchanged . Instead the Japanese claims of sovereignty of South Korea 's Dokdo Island and China 's Diaoyu Island were added . With regard to the Yasukuni Shrine where class A WW II criminals are honored , in spite of opposition from all sides , Koizumi persistently paid a series of five visits there from 2001 to 2005 .\n","\n","Koizumi has been in office for , four years . Well , during these four years , we can say , er , nothing has been much improved , whether in internal affairs or diplomacy . Originally , Koizumi , ah , took office because he won a very high support rating as a reformer . Eh , at that time , he pledged to reform Japan 's internal political and economic situations . However , based on the current status of internal affairs , his reform , ah , did not result , er , in what was expected at that time . In the diplomatic field , there has been constant friction with neighboring countries . So , right now , another important question is how exactly people in Japan view Koizumi 's diplomatic or internal policies , Professor Jin ? Well , this is , let 's say that Japanese people now have finally started to cool down in their attitude toward , this kind of impulsive actions . Uh-huh . Well , we know that among major Japanese newspapers , that is , the most dominant newspapers expressing popular opinions , ranging from Asahi Shimbun to Tokyo Shimbun , etc , well , recently , even Yomiuri Simbun , which originally expressed support for Koizumi 's right - wing tendencies , has started to change sides . Uh-huh . That is to say , their tones might be different , but the consensus of Japanese public opinion is that relations with Asian countries must be improved . So , this has already become the mainstream Japanese public opinion . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , specifically , it means prohibiting visits to Yasukuni Shrine . This has been opposed by the Liberal Democratic Party and all opposition parties . Well , we know that the most important pillar in Japan that supports the Japanese society is the Japanese business community . Well , the heads of several groups in the business community , for instance , the Japan Business Federation and the Japan Committee for Economic Development , all had frequent direct meetings with Koizumi , strongly cautioning him not to visit Yasukuni Shrine , Uh-huh . Uh-huh . because our economy will suffer if our Japan can not survive in the international community . Uh-huh . As a result , nowadays , Koizumi should be utterly isolated not only internationally but also domestically . Uh-huh .Right .\n","\n","Well , to Japanese people , what they are more concerned with is , for example , how my economy is developing , how my life will be , whether the national interests will be damaged , whether my personal interests will be affected , and so on and so forth . Well , we have noticed that in response to such questions , some analysts recently noted that Japan 's diplomacy will pay a heavy price for what he has been doing . As a matter of fact , Professor Liu , you also mentioned earlier that Japan 's economy , for instance , the Sino - Japanese trade , has already been affected to some extent . Well , have they started to pay the price already ? Well , I think , actually , as far as Japan itself is concerned , it still made some mistakes by itself . For instance , actually Koizumi won an overwhelming victory in the general election held on September 11 this year . At the same time his power to form the cabinet was further strengthened . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Er , he himself thought , er , that he was probably , , er , 200 % correct in what he has been doing . Uh-huh . However , in his diplomatic efforts , in terms of relations with neighboring countries , well , , we can say that he indeed failed miserably . Uh-huh . Well , this itself also failed to meet Japan 's own demand for economic development and the trend of strengthening economic and trade relations with foreign countries , in particular , the eastern Asian region , well , so as to bring about economic cooperation in this region . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , looking at Japan 's economy , we should say it is currently recovering its growth . Well , externally , it mainly relies on the US and Chinese markets . Uh-huh . However , if the Chinese market suffers from economic cool - down as political coldness takes heat off economic development , it should produce a very negative effect on Japan 's economy . Uh-huh . This effect may not show until probably next year . Uh-huh . Well , just now , that is to say , it was the political coldness that totally damaged its relations with neighboring countries . Uh-huh . Then , in terms of economy , he has also been unable to keep the economic heat on .Uh-huh .\n","\n","Well , we know , what all of us should be more concerned is his failure in international affairs . That is , this year marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations . Uh-huh . Japan placed its hope of becoming a permanent member of the Security Council this year . Uh-huh . Well , generally speaking , if it could n't get accepted this year , well , the chances in future are extremely slim . Uh-huh . Well , among many reasons that blocked Japan from getting accepted this year , the most important one was that its neighboring countries did not cast favorable votes . That is , it did not -- It failed to gain the support of countries in its own region . Right . To become a permanent member of the Security Council , the most important thing is to first win the support of your own region . Right . Well , right now it is its neighboring countries that did not support it . Uh-huh . Therefore , we should say that it is , right , this Prime Minister Koizumi who has single - handedly ruined Japan 's dream of becoming a permanent member of the Security Council . Uh-huh . This is the most serious cost .\n","\n","Some analysts also mentioned this point , that is to say , right now , Japan 's neighboring countries are basically very much disappointed with what Koizumi has been doing . Well , many countries have all abandoned their hopes to further mend their relations with Japan . In this respect , such a question follows , that is , how far could Koizumi go following his diplomatic policy ? Well , from what can be seen now , that is , actually , er , let 's say , from the cabinet he formed after his victory of the general election for the second time , we could indeed see that he has gathered , um , the statesmen , or politicians who approve visits to Yasukuni Shrine , Uh-huh . all into the cabinet , everyone of them , eh . He , right , appointed them as defense minister or foreign minister . Uh-huh . In fact we can see that he is sort of determined on this issue to fight against neighboring countries to the end . Uh-huh . This way , he actually sent out a message that he has no sincerity in , during his term , improving the relations with neighboring countries . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . This will indeed lead to the great disappointment of neighboring countries in him , and furthermore to their caution about whether next , the prime minister , the defense minister , including , er , the foreign minister would all go pay their respects at Yasukuni Shrine . If that is the case , it may have produced a very extensive negative impact on its relations with neighboring countries . Uh-huh . Well , actually , right now even the European and US media have noted this issue . Right . We , including US President Bush , who came to Pusan following his visit to Japan this time and then will arrive again in China , are , in fact , also very concerned with this future development of Sino - Japanese relations . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . That is because I recently met an American scholar whose first question to me was whether there will be any conflict in the East China Sea region . Uh-huh . Ah , I do n't think it would be that serious , but we can see that the international community has already shown tremendous concern about the chaos to international relations in this region that may have resulted from the Koizumi cabinet 's reckless diplomacy . Uh-huh . Uh-huh .\n","\n","In fact it is not merely an issue of Sino - Japanese relations or Japanese - Korean relations . It has triggered that -- Yeah . the nerves of the international community . Yeah . That is , the US public and scholars have , started to show concerns over the issue of right and wrong in WW II , the moral issue , that is , the US has started to pay attention to this issue . The US has kept quiet on the issue of Yasukuni Shrine because it wants to get along with everyone . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , it has been an onlooker to the fighting among eastern Asian countries . But now the US can no longer sit quietly any more . I think that if things go on like this , the US interests in this region are also going to suffer . Uh-huh . Uh-huh .Well , now let 's look at this Koizumi , that is , the post-Koizumi era . What are his standards for selecting his successor ? Is visiting Yasukuni Shrine a criterion ? Uh-huh . Yeah . This is one of the important indexes that , we should watch for regarding which road exactly Japan will take . However , based on the selection and formation of his , er , cabinet , it seems that Koizumi is making his post-resignation arrangements , ah . He has started to get ready . The Koizumi era , well -- Has already prepared -- Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , following that , for instance , if his successor is indeed Shinzo Abe , well , what will it mean if Shinzo Abe takes office ? Well , actually , I see , ah , Koizumi has dual purposes in arranging this cabinet , ah . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . That is , in fact , I now feel that he , er , is somewhat adopting a China policy that separates politics from economy . Uh-huh .\n","\n","Well , in politics , he will go against you , eh , mainly on the issues of Yasukuni Shrine and textbooks , but in economic and trade affairs , er , he still wants to safeguard Japan 's economic rights . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Right . He is using some , eh , people who are , for instance , er , relatively moderate and pragmatic toward China . Right . Right , right , right . for instance , a politician quite friendly with China , that is , Toshihiro Nikai , um , was appointed as minister of Economy , Trade and Industry . Uh-huh . Toshihiro Nikai . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , we also see that after Nikai took office , his speech on the Eastern China Sea issue , we should say , is quite appropriate . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Ah , in his opinion , he wants to have friendly negotiations , ah , with China if he sees that China , er , has taken any action . He does not think Japan 's unilateral action in this disputed area is friendly negotiation . Uh-huh . If it is impossible for talks to go on , it can still be postponed till future , en , when there is a chance to resume talks . Er , I think that to prevent the bilateral relations from suffering friction over specific issues , his attitude like this should be -- Uh-huh . But , can his diplomacy featuring two separate political and economic lines work ? Eh , we need to watch for it this year . Uh-huh .\n","\n","Well , now Koizumi is constantly sending out the message that he will step down voluntarily in September next year . Well , of course we could not believe completely 100 percent of what he said about this , because it is not certain whether they will make accommodations to let Koizumi stay in office . But , if he steps down in September next year , we will see who on this cabinet will be the prime minister . Uh-huh . Well , mainly we will see whether he gives priority to diplomacy or internal affairs and whether he is more a hawk or a dove . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . We know there are several other people , such as Sadakazu Tanigaki and other economic figures , and those people mentioned by Professor Liu just now like Toshihiro Nikai . Uh-huh . This Koizumi has made some preparations after all , that is , he made dual preparations . Uh-huh . So , we still have to urge this Japanese government , ah , not to continue isolating itself like this . We are certainly willing to watch for this , and will continue to monitor Japan .\n","\n","All right . For our final topic , let 's go back to the APEC meeting this time . Uh-huh . Well , as we mentioned earlier at the beginning , eh , a very important purpose for Koizumi to go to attend the APEC leaders ' summit in Pusan this time is to see if he could try to improve the relations with neighboring countries through talks with President Roh Moo - hyun , as if he were clutching at a life - saving straw . But , could you analyze and predict what kind of achievements he can make during his trip to Pusan ? Well , I think that actually the greatest achievement for him is that he should see facts . What kind of facts ? That is , the issue of right and wrong . Well , some people say that as China 's economy is growing , Japan is getting somewhat jealous . Er , as two powers are juxtaposed , the relations between the two countries have become somewhat tense . In reality it is not necessary so . For instance , China 's economy is growing , eh , and getting stronger , but we see the relations between China and South Korea are indeed developing rapidly . Uh-huh . Well , the current trade between China and South Korea has reached nearly 100 billion US dollars . Uh-huh . Er , within another period of time , er , that is , by 2012 when it is , the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Korea , 200 billion US dollars ' worth of economic trade can be reached . Yeah . So , this will have surpassed what it is now for Japan and China which still failed to reach 200 billion US dollars at this 33rd anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relations . Uh-huh . We can say , the economic development in South Korea and China , to borrow Roh Moo - hyun 's words , is developing rapidly . Uh-huh . In addition , we can see that South Korea has been improving its relations with all neighboring countries with the exception of Japan . Uh-huh . China has also significantly improved its relations with all neighboring countries with the exception of Japan . Uh-huh . It is the same with Russia . Yeah . We , should say that people in the world are very clear about what is right and wrong . It is all in the hearts of people . Yeah .\n","\n","I think this can only prove Koizumi 's stubbornness . I do n't think it is certain at this point that he will change suddenly and completely . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . That is to say , this time he could only further expose his poor diplomatic skills and his isolation to the international community . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , based on his past remarks and deeds , it is hard to determine whether he will suddenly change his diplomatic policy after he returns . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , there is very little chance in this regard . Er , judging from the situation he is in while participating in the APEC meeting , er , I am afraid he may not be suffering from friction with neighboring countries only . Apart from that , er , some sources disclosed , for instance , he has also had some problems on this issue with some Latin American countries . Yes . So , just as we mentioned at the start of the program , during his trip to Pusan , Koizumi must feel not only isolated but also surely frustrated . Uh-huh . All right . Thank you very much , ah , well , Professor Liu Jiangyong and Professor Jin Xide , for coming to our studio to participate in our program , ah , and introduce to us so much relevant information . Thank you two ! All right , dear viewers , that 's all for today 's Focus Today program . Thank you too , dear viewers , for watching !

Welcome to Focus Today . After repeatedly postponing his trip to Japan , Russian President Putin finally arrived at Japan 's Haneda Airport on November 20 , beginning a three - day visit to Japan . It can be said that the four northern islands issue is always an obstacle that Putin can not sidestep while visiting Japan . Heading a Russian business delegation of more than one hundred people this time , Putin wants to improve bilateral relations through promoting economic development . Well , how will the four northern islands issue dead knot be untied ? And will economic and trade exchange between Russia and Japan be hampered because of this ? These are all topics we will be focusing on today . Two experts have been invited to our studio . Let me briefly introduce , one is Mr. Jin Xide , an expert on Japanese issues from the Academy of Social Sciences . Hello ! The other one is Mr. Xing Guangcheng , an expert on Russian issues from the Academy of Social Sciences . Hello ! Welcome to the two experts , for coming to the studio for our interview . Well , at the beginning of the program , let 's learn about the situation in Japan . Let 's now connect via telephone with Mr. Wang Xinsheng , an expert on Japanese issues from Beijing University who is currently visiting Japan . Hello , Professor Wang . Ah , hello , host ! First , please brief us on what was discussed during today 's talks between the Russian and Japanese leaders . Was the four northern islands issue touched upon ? Eh , well , President Putin and Prime Minister Koizumi , ah , the two talked for a total of two and a half hours and signed a total of 12 documents . It should be said that quite a large number of documents were signed . However , the general reaction from scholars , media , or ordinary people here , er , is rather low key , because , er , there has been no progress on the two issues that Japan is relatively concerned with , the Northern Territories issue , er , and the oil pipeline route issue . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . \n","\n","Regarding the Northern Territories issue , , er , President Putin purposely avoided this issue , that is , he did not really want to talk about it . Uh-huh . Well , in fact , it can be said that there has still been no progress on territorial issues . Uh-huh . So the two sides abandoned plans for a joint declaration . Well , on the oil pipeline route issue , though the Russian side promised to connect it with Japan , there was no talk about prioritizing a connection with Japan . The media here is concerned because Russia already promised to prioritize connecting it with China , er , , so the media here is concerned that it is an empty promise . In this way , Japan may not get , er , any material benefit , while the Russian side will have gained Japan 's support for its WTO accession . Er , in addition , at the Business Federation meeting , Russian President Putin urged the Japanese business community to invest in Russia . However , due to the territorial issues , or little progress on the territorial issues , along with the business community 's concerns with the investment environment in Russia , well , it remains a big question how far economic cooperation can go . Uh-huh . Host . This was the main content of the two leaders ' talks today . Well , what kind of response did people in Japan have to , well , some of the achievements this trip to Japan has made ? Er , it is still rather , er , low key . that is to say , ah , er , we also saw , er , in Tokyo , some right - wing groups held demonstrations , demanding that Russia , return the four northern islands . Well , they are also extremely dissatisfied because no progress has been made on this issue . Well , both the media and citizens have such concerns , that is to say , they are afraid that resolution of territorial issues may take rather . Host . Okay , thank you very much , Professor Wang , for briefing us on the relevant information in Japan . Thank you !\n","\n","Well , next we will return to the studio to interview the two experts in the studio . Just now , this Professor Wang talked about Putin 's visit to Japan this time . Although the two sides signed 12 agreements , it seems that Japan is not very satisfied with the content of the agreements , ah , in terms of the content , because it seems that neither of the two issues that Japan wanted greatly to talk about , the four northern islands issue and the oil pipeline issue , made the achievements they had anticipated . Well , was this within the expectations of you two experts ? Right , this is rather consistent with unanimous international public opinion analysis as well as our opinion these days . Uh-huh . Well , , this discussion , it was a meeting of the leaders of both sides , which by itself is an achievement . Uh-huh . As we know , Putin has kept putting off this visit to Japan since last year , like back then when Yeltsin repeatedly postponed his trip to Japan . That is to say , Japan asked for too high a price . That is , it asked the Russian president to come to Japan to make concessions on territorial issues . Well , , well , the Russian president , was unwilling to make concessions . Therefore , the itinerary was not decided for a long time . Well , Russia 's attitude was that it would not talk about territorial issues if it went . Well , , from the perspective of Japan , without discussion of territorial issues , the talks were viewed as making no progress . For Japanese citizens , this was meaningless . Uh-huh . It only provided Koizumi with a diplomatic stage . What method does he want to use to remedy the lethargic post-APEC diplomatic situation ? Well , what Russia actually wants is economic cooperation with Japan , Uh-huh . including the development of oil resources in eastern Siberia , and , um , some other investment and trade . Well , Japan is still like this , saying first return the territories , then we can talk about economics . Well , , based on the outcome this time , I think this basic structure remains unchanged . Uh-huh .\n","\n","Er , Director Xing , it can be said that this time one of the very important purposes of President Putin 's visit to Japan is to facilitate the progress of bilateral relations through economic development . But from what our Professor Wang has just introduced , do you think Putin has achieved his aim ? Eh , he should be said to have achieved his aim . Uh-huh . The visit to Japan was in itself one of Putin 's important aims . Uh-huh . Because with large preconditions having been set , and now the framework having being set , it is impossible for Putin , that is to say , to make major breakthroughs on the substantive issues of Russian - Japanese relations . Uh-huh . Well , as two neighboring nations , ah , relations between them should be developed , development of relations should be further promoted . There should be exchanges back and forth , which would not work if Putin , refuses to come . So , well , , how did he come to Japan ? As mentioned earlier , ah , it had been postponed again and again , but by way of this kind of opportunity , well , Putin 's visit to Japan was smoothly accomplished . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . As to what kind of result you want , that is another matter . Right . But making the trip was significant in itself . What was the significance ? It was that Russia sent a very important message , that is , Russia is willing to develop relations with Japan . We sincerely have such a wish . A wish is the start of achieving results . We have such a start . Both leaders saved a bit of face . Right , right , right , in addition to giving face to each other . Also , on the surface we saw it looked fine , with , 12 documents signed as just mentioned . They both gave face . Right . It is another matter if you care about the size of the documents . But they were signed . Uh-huh . Well , can we interpret it this way ? Based on the briefing given by you two experts , both Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Russian President Putin , they both achieved their own aims in form and , er , obtained what they wanted through this visit . On this point , their two fates are connected . Uh-huh .That is to say , both sides have strong nationalist sentiments domestically and powerful parliaments . Well , I think at this point it would be ludicrous for Putin to concede on the territorial issues . Uh-huh . Well , as you should know , it is entirely , impossible behavior . Right . Well , it seems it may also be very difficult for Koizumi now , that is to say , on the territorial issues , to return to what is called , er , economics first , territories second , or , the separation of politics and economics , or two islands first , then two islands later . Uh-huh . Uh-huh .\n","\n","Well , recently , that is , , new Foreign Minister Aso proposed a theory of joint development , that is , to postpone -LSB- -LSB- the issue of sovereignty of the northern -RSB- -RSB- and to jointly develop the , , four islands . Well , in fact the theory of joint development was originally proposed by Russia . Well , in the past , for instance , in 1996 , Primakov also proposed it when he was foreign minister . It had been raised prior to that too , but Japan did not accept it at that time . Well , why did Taro Aso recently again propose , er , such a suggestion ? Well , I checked some data , ah . Japan 's recent reaction is not Japan 's mainstream domestic opinion . Uh-huh . Well , domestic political circles in Japan all opposed this suggestion by Taro Aso . Uh-huh . They said that with joint development , Russia would advocate adopting the current Russian controlled situation , the current situation , and applying Russian law . Well , by making investments there , in fact , well , it would be equivalent to permanent recognition that the four islands are Russia 's . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So this theory of joint development will not be able to make progress either . So under the current situation , the meeting of the two leaders itself was the greatest achievement this time . The rest did not have any substantive significance . Right . Uh-huh . I 'd like to add a few words . Regarding the joint development he talked about , Russia is also very interesting . the Japanese proposed it , now Russia instead rejected it . It rejected it , its government stated very clearly , we can not jointly develop the four northern islands . This is a very interesting issue . Right . They dropped it . Right . What do you say about this ? Er , , , , it , also has its vigilance . Well , this also has a lot to do with Russia 's strategy of building a powerful nation . Russia now , it has independently formulated a strategic vision of developing the Far East and Siberian regions . It has such a vision . Uh-huh . The four northern islands are included in this grand vision . Right .\n","\n","Today , among our topics , the four northern islands can be said to be the core topic . We can discuss this issue again in detail at the end . Well , before this , we have one more question , that is , er , regarding the issue of this Russian President Putin 's repeated postponement of his visit to Japan , well , many viewers may have some questions on this issue . Well , we happen to have a background video clip here . Let 's gain some understanding through this background video clip . Why did Russian President Putin visit Japan again after , an interval of five years , after quite a few twists and turns ? It can be said that Putin 's visit to Japan after an interval of five years was realized following quite a few twists and turns . The visit was first scheduled for the second half of 2004 . The Japanese side hoped that after winning the presidential election in March of that year , Putin could personally intervene in the territorial issues existing between Japan and Russia for a long time . However , by May , the Russian side said it could not provide measures for resolving the territorial issues , and Putin 's visit to Japan was pushed to the spring of 2005 . While Japan expressed helplessness to this , it hoped Putin could visit in February as it was the 150th anniversary of the signing of a trade and border treaty between Japan and Russia . However , Putin responded only with a congratulatory telegram , with no mention of his visit to Japan . On September 2 , 2004 , Koizumi went by boat to tour the four northern islands . This move at once infuriated Russia . Accordingly , the date of Putin 's visit to Japan turned into a variable which nobody could explain . In various versions , some said Putin would visit Japan in April 2005 , some said May , while others said June . In Russia 's diplomatic circles , there were even widespread rumors , including that Putin would not visit Japan within the year and that Russia 's ambassador to Japan would soon be removed . Various speculation existed until May 2005 , at the celebration of the 60th anniversary of victory in the world 's anti-fascist war . Under pressure from various sides , Koizumi reluctantly attended this celebration . Furthermore , precisely because of this , Putin 's visit to Japan was basically confirmed . This time , on this visit , er , between Russia and Japan , ah , er , as far as Japan was concerned , it really hoped that Russian President Putin would talk about the four northern islands issue during his visit . However , Russia 's thinking was , er , we want to develop the economy first . There should be economic cooperation before we can talk about the four northern islands issue , which means that currently the two sides both insist on a condition from the other side . Well , in this way , the conflict would become more conspicuous during the talks .\n","\n","Well , was this also the reason that caused Russian President Putin , in spite of the two being close neighbors these five years , to visit Japan again only after , an interval of five years ?  this is not just during Putin 's tenure , that is , it has been like this for the 60 years after the war . Uh-huh . That is , whether there should be a separation of politics and economics or not . That is , whether it should be economic cooperation first or resolution of political issues first . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , this eased for a period after the Cold War during the Gorbachev era . Uh-huh . That is , Gorbachev recognized the four islands issue between Japan and Russia . There was nothing like this in the past . In the past , only the issue of two islands was recognized . Well , there was once an opportunity for this , but Japan again did not seize it . Uh-huh . Russia has changed a lot as well . Well , later , that is , after several changes , for instance , during Hashimoto Ryutaro 's term , ah , Russia proposed separating politics from economics , to make progress on both at the same time . Uh-huh . However , when it came to the critical moment , that is , on the territorial issues , perhaps due to Japan 's domestic nationalist sentiments and the sensitivity of the territorial issues , it was impossible for any prime minister to claim for two islands only . Uh-huh . When talks on the two islands came to a final decision , the Japanese prime minister retreated again to the point that politics and economics could not be separated and that political issues should still be resolved first . Uh-huh . Well , in addition , the Russian president was exactly the opposite , that is , denying at critical moments that there were territorial issues , that is , sometimes even the issue of the two islands . Uh-huh . That is , it was impossible to give the territories to Japan . So , this shows how difficult it is to resolve Japanese - Russian relations . Uh-huh .\n","\n","I think in the near future , er , the possibility of breakthrough progress is also , very small . Eh , we all know Japan is the second largest economy in the world . Furthermore , Japan is also a very important investor overseas . However , a set of data shows that Japanese investment in Russia accounts for only 1 % of its investments overseas , that is , just over 700 million US dollars . Well , as Russia should be said to badly need Japanese funds , as well as badly needing Japanese economic cooperation , well , how urgent do you think Russia 's need is ? I think the time of Russia 's most urgent need is already over . Uh-huh . The most urgent time was still the 1990s . At that time , Russia was indeed pressing for Japanese investment . Uh-huh . Because Russia was in a deep degree of overall crisis . Uh-huh . It was like a very thirsty man who needs to drink water . At such time , he , needs someone else to give him a cup of water . Uh-huh . Well , now , the economic crisis in Russia is essentially over . Well , under such circumstances , Russia , er , it can make diplomatic arrangements calmly . Uh-huh . Therefore , I think Japan , that is , again lost the best opportunity to enter the Russian market . Uh-huh . It can not be said to have lost it forever . In other words , that time was the best , a relatively good period . Uh-huh . Why should we say that ? That is to say , at that time if Japan had made a very good investment in Russia , well , Japan , in terms of Russia 's economy , it could have helped Russia 's economic recovery .\n","\n","Uh-huh . Well , currently Japan is very important to Russia again . Well , as a neighboring nation , especially as Japan is a world economic power , Russia really needs Japanese investment , now not Japanese aid , but its investment . Uh-huh . It can also be said it is this way strategically . Putin 's current strategy is to build a powerful nation , a strategy for making his country powerful and his people rich . Uh-huh . Well , this strategy is extremely clear . He used an expression , saying that Russia 's diplomacy is economic diplomacy . All , diplomatic activities must promote Russia 's prosperity , eh , development , and wealth and power . Uh-huh . Well , seen from this perspective , well , Japan is very important to Russia . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Therefore , just now you mentioned some figures regarding Russian - Japanese relations , that is , economic and trade relations , for such a large , such a powerful economy as Japan , well , it invested only 700-plus million in Russia . This is extremely small . Uh-huh . Said it will be ten billion . Well , last year 's trade volume was perhaps more than 9 billion . This year , , Koizumi said it may exceed 100 trillion . This is a very small figure in terms of trade relations between two countries . It has nearly reached 200 billion between China and Japan . So . Right . Here it has a comparison . er , between Russia and Japan , the trade volume only equals , of Sino - Japanese trade volume , one twenty - second . Uh-huh . Right . It seems to be one twenty - second , or one nineteenth . Well , what does this status show ? Right , just about , eh . I will explain two issues -- one , it may show that the economic environment in Russia is indeed not very good . Uh-huh . In general , none of the , eh , large nations in the world , have entered the Russian market with much ease . Uh-huh . This is an objective factor , but there is a subjective factor too . That is to say , it is not that Japan does not need the Russian market . Perhaps some non-economic factor is playing a role . It has always been the territorial issue . Well , as we said , this kind of nationalist sentiment plays a great role here . So one very important aim of Putin 's visit this time , which I also think is very clever , is to put aside some very sensitive old territorial topics . This topic is hard to tackle . Uh-huh . However , he can promote the development of economic relations , as economics is a dynamic factor .\n","\n","Uh-huh . Putin came this time bringing more than 100 people , such a large delegation , to Japan . He still intends to solicit businesses and investment , to use our Chinese expression , yet this intention is very obvious . Right , right . Right , I think . However , based on this outcome , the form still seems to have outdone the content . I think that with regard to Japan 's relations with Russia , it has been like this since the 1970s . When Tanaka Kakuei went there , he also did this . I will invest , I will give you aid to develop eastern Siberia . That 's because Russia has a vast area of land . We know the population is small , that is to say they can not develop it . That is , the treasure is all hidden underground . Well , at that time , , they still wanted to solve the population problem . Uh-huh . So , that is , Japan used economics for political purposes . Uh-huh . Well , now it seems that Koizumi has still not changed this course . Uh-huh . Well , this way , I do n't think this dead knot can be untied . Also , if things continue like this , increasing the nations  mutual trust can never be realized .\n","\n","Yes , , eh , just now Director Xing mentioned a very important issue , that is , the nationalist sentiment . In fact , regarding Putin 's visit to Japan this time , the media earlier predicted , among other things , that when the time came , there would be more than 60 groups totaling more than 700 people , along with , hey , more than 200 propaganda trucks on the streets of downtown Tokyo , to protest against Putin 's visit to Japan . Well , what forces do these people and groups holding street protests represent ? What are they asking for ? And what impact will it have on Putin 's visit to Japan ? Okay . They are some focused right - wing groups , similar to a gang society . But , with regard to this Russian issue , ah , this can not be simply regarded as a handful of people making trouble , because there are widespread historical grievances among ordinary people in Japan against Russia . I have had contact with many Japanese . That is to say , this involves the origin of the Northern Territories issue . Well , I think it originated a long time ago and involves three major issues . One is that historically and legally , it has changed several times . For instance , in 1855 , in 1875 , and in 1905 after the Russo - Japanese War , and also WW II , at these critical points , ownership of the territories was constantly changing . With ancestors constantly changing , both sides had their own arguments . In fact , ownership of the Northern Territories has changed several times , and there has been no single law . Therefore , there is truth on both sides . Uh-huh . Now Russia says this was the result of WWII international laws and treaties , with the US also recognizing it at that time . Uh-huh . The entire international community recognizes that the four islands should belong to Russia . Both the Yalta Agreement and Article 2 of the San Francisco Treaty recognize Japan 's relinquishment of the Kuril Islands . However , then there is a lot of nationalist sentiment , that is , Japan believes that the Soviet Union unilaterally broke the Pact of Neutrality , sending troops into Northeast China and defeating the Kwantung Army . For things like this , as Japan looks at this piece of history -- also , Japanese captives were dragged to Siberia to labor camps -- I heard there were 100,000 , 200,000 . Uh-huh . Well , there is also a nationalist sentiment issue ; also , including this , these have all been brought together . Therefore , unraveling this historical feud , the Northern Territories issue , is not so clear - cut , since history , society , and law , as well as nationalist sentiments are all entangled together .\n","\n","Yeah . Just now you mentioned the origin of the four northern islands . Well , today we have been talking about the four northern islands issue . Well , how exactly did the four northern islands issue originate ? Let 's learn something about it . The four islands , Iturup , Shikotan , the Khabomai Rocks , and Kunashir , are located in the northern part of the western Pacific Ocean , with a total area of about 5,000 square kilometers , which Japan calls the four northern islands , and Russia calls Southern Chishima . Their surrounding sea waters have a great wealth of fishing resources and undersea mineral deposits , with highly important strategic positions . The ownership of these four islands has long been a dead knot in Russian - Japanese relations that has been difficult to untie . In August 1945 , the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in succession . To ask the Soviet Union to declare war against Japan , the US and Britain gave Russia the Chishima Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin Island , which Japan occupied at the time . In 1955 the Soviet Union and Japan began negotiations regarding the normalization of relations . The then Soviet Union indicated willingness to return the Khabomai Rocks and Shikotan . Yet Japan requested that the Soviet Union return Iturup and Kunashiri as well . It also requested that the Soviet Union promise to attend the international peace conference to determine the ownership of Sakhalin and the entire Chishima Islands . Negotiations broke down as a result . In 1956 , the then Soviet Union restated its willingness to return the Khabomai Rocks and Shikotan . Japan again said that unless the four islands were returned together , the Soviet proposal could definitely not be accepted . For a long time , Japanese - Russian relations have not made breakthrough progress due to the deadlocked four northern islands issue . Today , already more than 50 years after the end of WW II , the two nations have still not signed a peace treaty realizing the complete normalization of bilateral relations . In the literal sense , if the two nations have not signed a peace treaty , it means at this point the two nations are still at war . As the two experts are constantly discussing , saying that the four northern islands issue is a dead knot in Japanese - Russian relations , yet this dead knot , it seems that currently both sides have this idea , they want to untie this dead knot . Well , we noticed , er , just now this short clip also talked about it , at that time the Soviet Union agreed to return two islands first , , but , eh , Japan never agreed . But now , we also notice that , Taro Aso proposed a new idea , the joint development that the Soviet Union had previously talked about . Well , can this point lead to a breakthrough in the two nations ' resolution of the four northern islands issue ?\n","\n","I think it is very hard , as joint development and sovereignty of the islands are , ah , two concepts . It wo n't work , either , eh , eh . But this is relevant . Uh-huh . Oh , as I just mentioned , it was against a large background that Russia first proposed it . Uh-huh . With , quite a troubled economy , Russia needed Japanese investment , needed Japan to get involved through this channel . Uh-huh . Well , now that its economy has greatly improved , Russia does not need to take this diplomatic risk . Uh-huh . This is one . Second , Russia should be seen as a rather strong nation . Well , this place , the four northern islands , is a very sensitive region for the Russian psyche . Any small , small diplomatic or economic action will affect the psyche of Russian citizens . Uh-huh .\n","\n","Uh-huh . So , well , Putin 's visit to Japan this time , or during his visit to Japan , or prior to this , there were rallies in the Far East region , including the Sakhalin area , meant to give many warnings to Putin . Uh-huh . Well , Russian politicians also made many appeals regarding this . Well , one Russian politician stated very clearly that while Russia 's territory is vast , Russia does not have territories to spare . This is a very , very , eh , tough kind of issue . Well , as I just said very clearly , that is to say , in addition to the legal and historical complications , the repeated change of ownership , and then national sentiments as well , the four northern islands are also strategically very important . That is , does n't Russia advocate a double - headed eagle policy ? Right , right . It is both a European and Asian nation . Well , if he wants development in Asia , wo n't he close the door if he loses hold of the four northern islands now ? Uh-huh . Fisheries . The four northern islands not only have mineral deposits , oil , and fisheries , but also for military strategy , they are key positions in the Pacific Ocean . In the Pacific Ocean , right . Currently Russia seems to be in a period of low tide , but it wo n't stay this way forever . Right , right , right . It is still a large nation . It is still a large nation . It is also an international power . Therefore , none of its leaders can easily give away the four northern islands . let me again add some words , if it wants joint development , Japanese companies and Japanese influence will enter the four northern islands . Right , right . Well , after entering , , economic influence may lead to political influence . Currently that would seem to benefit Japan . Yes . It would benefit Japan . Russia has foreseen the consequences . That 's why Russia now rejects it . It was originally proposed by Russia , but rejected by Japan . Uh-huh . This is a new incarnation , but with different political significance . \n","\n","Uh-huh . Well , since the four northern islands issue is a dead knot in bilateral relations that can not be untied , and also both are working hard , yet with seemingly little hope in sight , well , how can Japanese - Russian relations develop under such circumstances ? I think both sides generally know the two sides ' levels of political operations , knowing that territorial issues are hard to resolve . So , with this issue having gone on for many years , both sides may have a bottom line . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . That is , they wo n't say we will stay opposed to each other as long as it is unresolved . Uh-huh . So it may be like this . That is to say , in the future both sides may become more reasonable on this issue . That is , looking farther ahead , normalization of relations will still be gradually developed . Uh-huh . That is , do n't always get stuck on the territorial issue . But on the other hand , the territorial issue is also quite important and sensitive . So it is unrealistic for you to say there will be breakthrough progress in Japanese - Russian relations and that their economic and trade relations will suddenly achieve 100 billion . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So the prospects for Japanese - Russian relations are not too good . Uh-huh . That is , it will be , that is , very common , , relatively bland kind of relationship .\n","\n","Uh-huh . That is , Russian - Japanese relations , from the perspective of Russia , I do n't see many changes in the large framework of Russian - Japanese relations . Well , Mr. Xing , how do you view Russian - Japanese relations ? That is to say , these basic tones have been set . The main issue is the four northern islands . However , current signs show that Russia and Japan are moving forward on economic issues , on economic cooperation . Uh-huh . Yes . I will give two examples . One example is that this year Toyota Motor has invested in St. Petersburg . Uh-huh . In addition , Putin attended the ribbon - cutting ceremony . This is , quite a clear signal . That is to say , -- Japan has now invested in Russia . Second , what Japan hopes to get is , hey , Russia 's oil . Uh-huh . Though Russia did not make a final commitment , there is already a general framework . Uh-huh . That is to say , eventually Russia 's oil pipeline will be connected to a Pacific Ocean port , which will benefit Japan . Uh-huh . That is , although there are obstacles in bilateral relations , they are still exploring forward movement . Right . Uh-huh . Okay , well , today we will end our discussion here on the topic of Putin 's visit to Japan . Thanks very much to the two experts for coming to the studio for our interview . Thanks to you two . Okay , dear viewers , that 's all for today 's edition of Focus Today . Thank you for watching . See you tomorrow at the same time .\n","\n","There will be 120 million viewers tuning in to this evening reception . This has been a CCTV report . Dear viewers , that 's all for the China News program . This is Xu Li , thank you all for watching ! Coming up next , please stay tuned to Focus Today hosted by Wang Shilin . Dear viewers , good-bye !\n","\n","News and events happen every day . What you are interested in is exactly what we will be focusing on . This is CCTV Focus Today . A British newspaper revealed that the US had planned to bomb the al - Jazeera TV station in Qatar . Was this a joke told by US President Bush or was it a long - meditated threat ? Did British Prime Minister Blair know nothing about it , or did he succeed in persuading his ally to give up the idea of attacks ? What exactly is the truth ? Why can a TV station in a small Arab country have US President Bush on pins and needles ? Focus Today is coming up in a minute .\n","\n","Hello , dear viewers , welcome to Focus Today . On November 22 , the British newspaper Daily Mirror revealed that US President Bush once planned to bomb the al - Jazeera TV station headquarters , setting off a mighty uproar . The two British nationals charged with leaking the information already appeared in court for interrogation yesterday for the first time . According to a report by the British newspaper the Guardian , al - Jazeera TV station is now considering suing US President Bush for this matter . Well , what exactly was this incident ? Why has al - Jazeera TV station become a thorn in Bush 's side ? These are all the topics we will be focusing on today . Two honorable guests have been invited to our studio . Let me give you an introduction . One is Mr. Ruan Zongze , vice director of the China Institute of International Studies . Mr. Ruan Zongze has done extensive researches on British and US issues . The other is Mr. Wu Huixuan , former CIR chief correspondent based in Qatar . Hello ! Welcome you two to the studio for our interview . Well , at the start of today 's program , let 's learn about the full context of this incident together . We will first talk about the Daily Mirror article that started it . What we are seeing now on screen is a very popular newspaper in Britain called the Daily Mirror . Next , let 's see ; this is a November 22 article . The title goes like this : Exclusive report : Bush Planned to Bomb his Arab Ally, Well , let 's now look at the content of the article . The article writes that the minutes of a meeting between British Prime Minister Blair , who was visiting the US on April 16 , 2004 , and US President Bush at the White House showed that Bush had intended to take military actions against al - Jazeera TV station headquartered in the Qatari capital of Doha . Then , Blair said to Bush that such an action would trigger a worldwide uproar . These are some records of the conversation between the two men .\n","\n","Let 's now look at this article . let 's look at this line marked with a black frame , which writes : Undoubtedly Bush wanted to do this . And equally without doubt , Blair did not want him , that is , Bush , to do this . Well , it happened , er , that our correspondent did an interview at the al - Jazeera 's Beijing office today and happened to videotape the image we are watching now , which was broadcast live by al - Jazeera TV station . It was the news about Bush 's plan to bomb al - Jazeera TV station . So what we are seeing on screen was exactly transmitted by al - Jazeera TV station . Well , yesterday the two British nationals involved in the disclosure of the incident were interrogated by the court . Well , here is the scene of the two persons under interrogation . In the meantime , al - Jazeera TV station also protested several times upon learning the information . Well , this is a brief introduction of the context of the incident . Well , regarding this topic , the first question today is that we want to find out clearly whether this incident was real or not . Let 's start with this newspaper . Well , Director Yuan , I know that you also once worked in Britain . Well , what kind of newspaper is the Daily Mirror ? It is said to have a very large circulation , but people still call it a tabloid . So how accurate is the news carried by it ? This is true . Its circulation should be considered one of the largest among British newspapers . Uh-huh . But at the same time , interestingly , it is not a mainstream newspaper , either . Uh-huh . That is why it is called a tabloid , because it does not belong to the mainstream in the current British newspaper industry . It is still called a tabloid . It is placed together with other city newspapers , yet it is also a newspaper of national circulation with an extremely powerful influence . Uh-huh . Uh-huh .\n","\n","Its influence is mainly on ordinary readers , the general public . That 's because most British newspapers have their own steady readership . They have different levels of readership , ah . Right , they have a fairly steady readership . Right . Well , this newspaper is said to have various kinds of topics appropriate to all ages . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Well , so , now we need to seriously consider its authenticity or accuracy . Is the news carried by it credible or not ? How much is its accuracy , I think , is still quite hard to determine at this time , indeed , Uh-huh . because I will mainly speak from two perspectives . First , when the Mirror got hold of the news , it called 10 Downing Street the first night , saying that it had such information . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Well , it meant to find out whether 10 Downing Street had anything to say , but Downing Street said it had no comments . Uh-huh . However , when the news was released , it set off such a mighty uproar . Uh-huh . This is the first point . The second point is to look at the reaction of al - Jazeera TV station . What al - Jazeera TV station is now asking Britain to do is to either confirm the news as true or to deny it . Uh-huh , uh-huh . However , right now , Britain has neither said it is true nor said it is not . That is the situation . It did not confirm anything . However , there is still one detail . When we introduced the context information , we also mentioned the two staff members involved in the leakage of the information . These two staff members , also considered British government employees , have already been under interrogation . Well , since they are under interrogation , it means they may have indeed divulged the secret .\n","\n","Could this be used to determine that there was indeed such an incident ? There was such an incident , um , uh-huh . I think there are two questions involved in this matter . One is whether there is any secret being divulged , and the other is whether the news that Bush wanted to bomb al - Jazeera TV station is true . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . I think these are two different questions . Uh-huh . Regarding the leakage of the secret , it seems that the possibility here , ah , is really big . What secret exactly was divulged ? Um . Because according to the British , um , government , um , its Official Secrets Act Section 5 , that is to say , it is illegal for newspapers or media to publicize indiscreetly government information obtained through unauthorized channels . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , well , these two people have already been suspected of violating this section , and that is why they have been sued . Right . Well , of course it is still in a preliminary stage right now , and yesterday a hearing lasting only 15 minutes was held . Uh-huh . But , both of these two people denied they were guilty . Uh-huh . So , now it will still have to go through a quite lengthy judicial procedure . Eh , in other words , although they were interrogated , whether the secret leaked was something like our topic today , that is , Bush said he wanted to bomb al - Jazeera TV station , whether the secret divulged was this record , these are still two different things . However , it should be closely related to this because this is about the so - called memo . Uh-huh . It should be closely related . Yeah . Uh-huh . On April 16 of last year when Blair was visiting the US , they had some exchange between them . That was how this memo came into being . It was about five pages long . Right . Uh-huh . Well , in this memo , Bush seemed to imply that he probably wanted to bomb this al - Jazeera TV station . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . At that time Blair tried his best to persuade him not to do it . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , but the very authenticity of the incident , I think , still needs to be determined by the British government or US government . They need to come out for making clarification and judgment .\n","\n","Yeah . Well , Mr. Wu , we know , ah , you worked as a reporter in Qatar and were very familiar with al - Jazeera TV station . So how do you look at this incident ? Do you think it is real or not ? Um . I think it is possible that the US wanted to bomb al - Jazeera TV station . Uh-huh . That 's because all the things reported by al - Jazeera TV station since its establishment in 1996 were those the US did not want viewers in the world to look at , especially with respect to the Afghan war and Iraq war . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . What they reported was entirely incompatible with the so - called freedom of the press advocated by the US . Uh-huh . For instance , the US attacked al - Jazeera TV station several times . It happened once that when Bush , er , together with that Defense Secretary Rumsfeld visited Qatar , they , put pressure on the Qatari government , saying you should not broadcast these news items that were harmful to the US . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , later , under such circumstances , eh , the director of al - Jazeera TV station was replaced once . Uh-huh . Under his pressure . Uh-huh . But , the leader of al - Jazeera TV station , Jazeera , ah , Qatar replied that we advocate the same freedom of the press as the freedom of the press in your country and that our government has no right to interfere with what is being reported by a private TV station . That is to say , eh , according to your judgment , this incident was possible because the US has long considered it a thorn in its flesh .Right . So , to say that the US government or the US president had such an idea , you think many people may easily believe it . Yeah . There is such possibility . Right , yes . All right , regarding whether this incident was real or not , according to you two , eh , there is indeed a lot of information . There are no waves without wind . Yeah . Right , there are no waves without wind . So , this incident probably does have some basis . Some basis .\n","\n","Well , let 's now focus on this al - Jazeera TV station . As a matter of fact , when we watch TV , we can see many news services , ah , including the US CNN and the British BBC , often replaying footage by al - Jazeera TV station . Since the al - Jazeera TV station logo is on , people should be quite familiar with al - Jazeera TV station . The station logo , right . Yeah . But how did this al - Jazeera TV station rise to fame competing with so many Western media outlets in news coverage ? Let 's learn about this through another background video clip . Al - Jazeera TV station , established in November 1996 in Qatar , is an Arabic - language news TV station broadcasting global news and reports nonstop around the clock . Its staff all comes from various Arab countries , and its viewership has reached 50 million . Prior to its establishment , there has been no Arabic - language TV station broadcasting news nonstop around the clock in the Arab world . In September 2001 , the 9 / 11 attacks broke out in the US . On October 7 , the US and Britain launched military strikes on the Taliban in Afghanistan . As a result , another news war erupted in the international media community . When people all over the world expected to watch the live broadcast of the war by the US CNN , they could only see a few blurry images on TV . Meanwhile , however , the little known al - Jazeera TV station based in the small Gulf country of Qatar suddenly emerged to broadcast the progress of the Afghan war in Arabic language and mobilized its 27 reporting stations all over the world to conduct an around - the - clock follow up coverage . When the Taliban regime announced that reporters from all countries were banned from entering the territory of Afghanistan , al - Jazeera TV station was the only one that could enter the Taliban - controlled area . Taking such an advantage , al - Jazeera TV station started to establish its unique leading position in covering the Afghan war with its frequent live broadcast of missile attacks on the Afghan capital of Kabul . During the war , al - Jazeera TV station continued to broadcast exclusive news and images under its logo and sell them to competitors at the high price of 20,000 US dollars per minute . While the US military searched everywhere for information on bin Laden in vain , al - Jazeera TV station frequently aired the footage of bin Laden making a speech .\n","\n","Mr. Wu , we know that you happened to be in Qatar when al - Jazeera TV station was just established in 1996 . Right . In addition , you were said to have attended the inaugural broadcast ceremony . What did al - Jazeera TV station look like when it just started broadcasting ? What kind of news broadcast style was featured at that time ? Er , they held an inaugural broadcast ceremony at the end of November 1996 at that time . We reporters in Qatar were also invited to attend this inaugural broadcast ceremony . Uh-huh . There were n't many people at the time . Uh-huh . But at the time of its establishment , this , er , al - Jazeera TV station already had a very good foundation in terms of reporters . Uh-huh . Why ? In 1995 , um , the British BBC 's Arabic Language TV Station was shut down due to funding problems . Uh-huh . So , al - Jazeera TV station seized this opportunity to get hold of , this entire group of people by hiring them , er , as their reporters , editors , or anchors at high salaries . Uh-huh . So , they had a relatively good team of reporters . Uh-huh . Well , this way , later it followed that , er , er , , , er , six - Chinese - character principle of news reporting called , er , independence , neutrality , ah , neutrality , balance , and freedom . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , what it reported was in a completely different style from that of some other Arab TV stations . Right . In this respect , that is , let me add one point , that is , this al - Jazeera TV station , ah , its style is very much characterized by direct borrowing from the West , for instance , the two mainstream media outlets . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Right . Uh-huh . One is CNN , and the other is BBC . Yeah . Well , I think that BBC , in particular , has quite a big influence on it .Just now , that is to say , many of its reporters directly came from the Middle East channel at that time .\n","\n","Uh-huh . That was jointly run by BBC and Saudi Arabia . So it had a very good foundation . In addition , that is , actually , this al - Jazeera TV station has a quite unique structure . That 's because the emir of this country is called Hamad . He studied in Britain and therefore had quite a good knowledge of Britain 's BBC TV station . He also quite admired it . So , in this way , it has borrowed some of the BBC style . For instance , Britain 's BBC is a very old TV group established in 1927 . Uh-huh . Though it is funded by the government with many of its properties owned by the government , it still follows the guideline of editorial independence . Uh-huh . For instance , the top decision - making body of BBC is called the board of directors which are composed of twelve members directly appointed by the Queen . Uh-huh . So al - Jazeera TV station has also adopted this structure . It has a top seven - member board of directors . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . However , even if its property , ah , and funds can come from the government , it still relatively has its editorial independence . Eh , but in essence , Mr. Wu , is it really a private TV station or a government - run TV station ? Er , they themselves claim that it is a private TV station , but in reality it could not have been established without a large amount of financial support given by the government . That 's because it , eh , has an extremely small number of ads during its around the clock , ah , TV broadcast . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , in addition , it has such a large team , especially with high , high , er , wages , and reporters based abroad , so many reporters abroad . If the government had not supported such expenditures , eh , it would be impossible for a private TV station to survive . According to your knowledge , how much is its yearly expenditure ? It was said that the yearly expenditures seem to be about 7 billion US dollars . About 7 billion US dollars , that is equivalent to more than 50 billion RMB . We should say this is a very huge financial expenditure .Uh-huh . Extremely large . Yeah . Therefore , some people call it gaining voice but losing money because it has relatively small revenues due to few ads . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . But it has a tremendous influence . Right . So , it appears that it is still not bad in gaining voice as it does achieve some effect . Yeah .\n","\n","Ha . Well , speaking of its influence , we have also noticed that er , during the Afghan war , er , because it has the exclusive interview right to enter Afghanistan to conduct independent and exclusive interviews , we could say this is one of its advantages . Uh-huh . It also presented an opportunity to it as well . Well , to the development of a TV station , both opportunity and real strength are actually very important . Well , as al - Jazeera TV station has been able to develop into its current status , what do you think has it relied upon so that its competitiveness and influential power , even surpassed CNN and BBC during the Iraq war ? The greatest feature of al - Jazeera TV station is that it is a small station that competes with large ones and has become well - known through wars . That is , the reason why it can establish itself is that it first relied on the Afghan war , and then the Iraq war after the 9 / 11 . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , it made full use of these two opportunities . In addition , as the Iraq war occurred right in an Arab country , everyone is very much concerned with what is going on in the war . So , this provides it with a large viewership , making it instantly famous . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Besides , it has a lot of resources , including its exclusive coverage right in Afghanistan as you mentioned just now . Uh-huh , uh-huh . In addition , al - Jazeera TV station is actually quite unique in the Arab region . For instance , a very tough conflict in this region is the conflict between Palestine and Israel . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , in general , Arabs will not invite the Israeli leader to make a speech on their TV . However , for al - Jazeera TV station , it could invite Barak , the Israeli prime minister at that time , to deliver a speech at al - Jazeera TV station . This was unprecedented in the Arab world . Right . Uh-huh . Well , this also gave it a very unique perspective . Uh-huh . So , the reason why it is successful , to put it simply , I think , is that it mainly relies on its own very professional news team . It has a very talented team , eh . Yeah . In addition , it also looks at major events as they happen from the unique perspective of the Arab region or Arab world . Uh-huh .\n","\n","I think that favorable opportunities and geographical conditions also helped because people involved in the Afghan war and the Taliban were mostly Arabs . Uh-huh . They were from Arab countries . They spoke the Arabic language . Well , that was the opportunity . In particular , it was the same with the , Iraq war , which took place in Iraq . In the , Iraq war , as far as I know , among foreign media teams dispatched to Iraq for coverage , I should say , the one from Qatar 's al - Jazeera TV station was the most powerful . Uh-huh . It had three reporting stations at that time , one group in the south in Basra , well , one group in Baghdad , and still another group in the north in Mosul . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So it was basically covering the , um , Iraq war from all perspectives . So , it surely surpassed some Western media in covering the Iraq war in certain areas . Uh-huh . We could say it owed its success to good opportunities , which it seized ; Yes . favorable geographical conditions ; that is to say , it happens to be located geographically in the Arab world ; Yeah . and also harmonious human conditions ; that is to say , it has its own very rounded and talented team . Er , that is why it is highly influential and competitive . However , as it is becoming more and more influential and competitive , it has also become a thorn in the US side . Well , today we should say we have just given an introduction of al - Jazeera TV station .\n","\n","Well , next let 's learn about more . What conflicts are there between al - Jazeera TV station and the US ? Why has it become a thorn in the US side ? Since it gained instant fame during the Afghan war , the style of al - Jazeera TV station in pursuit of the freedom of the press and independence has gradually won widespread international attention . However , at the same time , the conflict between al - Jazeera TV station and the US has been increasing . According to reports , Bush , Rumsfeld , and Powell repeatedly expressed their strong displeasure with al - Jazeera TV station directly to the Qatari leaders , demanding its government to restrain it more firmly . The US government thinks that radicals , anti-American and religious commentators have become frequent guests at al - Jazeera TV station . In particular , bin Laden has chosen it as his exclusive information release agency , endowing it with a unique advantage . All these made the US hate and fear al - Jazeera TV station at the same time . Officials of the Bush administration called it Osama 's TV station on different occasions because bin Laden 's full name is Osama bin Laden . During the Iraq war , al - Jazeera TV station not only broadcast Bush 's and Blair 's impassioned pre-war speeches and the image of coalition troops marching toward Iraq , but also broadcast the bloody bodies of civilians next to bombed cars . The video camera scanned over the corpses of coalition troops killed by the Iraqi military , and over that little tearful boy with bandages around his head , crying . If you see the war on the US TV as an electronic game and grand display of smoke and fire , then from the footage by al - Jazeera TV station , you see the war only as hell . Do you still remember , ah , during the Afghan war and the Iraq war , we could often see on screen the al - Jazeera footage such as bin Laden and some other al - Qaeda leaders giving speeches . Ah , moreover , the footage that many other TV stations were using also basically came from al - Jazeera TV station . Therefore , at that time Americans , said that since al - Jazeera TV station broadcast these activities of terrorists , it must be colluding with terrorists . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , it was always thought that there seemed to be some subtle relationship between al - Jazeera TV station and al - Qaeda . Taciturn agreement . Taciturn agreement . Yeah . Taciturn agreement .\n","\n","Right , Mr. Wu , how do you look at this issue ? This may have something to do with the good opportunities and favorable geographical conditions mentioned earlier . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Since , er , the Taliban people were all Arabs , they tried by various means to gain the information so as to expand their own influence . This has been the consistent practice of al - Jazeera station . Uh-huh . Well , the same goes with the Iraq war . They , eh , also speak Arabic , right ? Another Arabic nationality . Uh-huh . What they reported , eh , was very much welcomed and favored by Arab viewers . Uh-huh . That 's because what they have reported can not be found in the Western media reports . That 's why their fame grows . That is to say , it indeed inspires a kind of patriotic or nationalistic sentiments among Arab countries . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . I think , this point is very important . In other words , it also benefits from the hard work of al - Jazeera TV station . That is , it is from the perspective of Arabs that it looks at the war or also looks at major events . So , when it makes a report , its perspective , analysis , and its possible outcome or some process of its analysis are different from those of reports by the Western mainstream media such as CNN and BBC . Well , it is exactly because of this , even if al - Jazeera TV station may not be necessarily linked with any other organizations , simply because it reports the war using a different voice , it has become the target of attacks by the US or the West .Right .\n","\n","Well , regarding this incident , what kind of reaction did al - Jazeera TV station have ? We do n't have much information right now . But when our correspondents went to have an interview at the al - Jazeera TV station 's Beijing office today , they asked their office administrator named Ezzat , ah , the question why the US threatened to bomb al - Jazeera TV station ? He is also a China expert and speaks excellent Chinese . Let 's hear what he said .-- In the Middle East region , in particular , currently , , some US officials , for instance , many Democrat officials , they admitted that the US policies on Iraq and the Middle East , eh , region have many mistakes . Er , this point must be acknowledged . However , up till now , er , the Bush administration , they did not want to assume responsibility for what they have done there . So , it wanted to blame its mistakes in this region on al - Jazeera TV station . Second , it is because some things are in conflict with its interests . However , when I report , I do n't report for the sake of making somebody happy or not making somebody unhappy . This is not my principle , nor is my job . Some of the footage we broadcast did not conform to its interests . So it started to put this restrictive measure in retaliation . So , the issue is not that al - Jazeera TV station is making anti-American reports . In addition , the US government is carrying out some measures and work against these people in the Middle East region and against the world peace . As you know , we were , eh , reporting the war in Fallujah . Our reporter also , eh , almost had an accident there as several shots were purposely , er , fired at him . Then , in the end , er , Secretary Rumsfeld also directly blamed al - Jazeera TV station . Er , , er , most of what the reporter said , er , was groundless . In the end , later , did we say anything later ? We stopped talking . We then showed viewers facts and let the images speak by themselves . We did not do anything at that time . Our reporters were forced not to make any commentaries or any reports . We simply showed people the footage about Fallujah.\n","\n","Well , the facts may not conform to the interests of Mr. Bush . Uh-huh , uh-huh . In fact he mentioned a very important point of view here . Ah , Uh-huh. That is to say , this al - Jazeera TV station , due to its unique perspective , is different from what is expected of it . At al - Jazeera TV station , there is , one famous saying , that is , if the whole world listens to CNN , or the whole world watches CNN , then whom does CNN watch or listen to ? That is also an issue of the right of speech . Well , in fact , the US has long been suppressing al - Jazeera TV station . For instance , the al Jazeera TV station 's office in Afghanistan was bombed in 2001 . Yeah . Uh-huh . Well , in 2003 , the al - Jazeera TV station 's office in Baghdad was also bombed . On April 8 , its reporting station in Baghdad was bombed , and one reporter was killed . Yeah . Right . In addition , currently one of its reporters is still detained by the US at the Guantanamo military base . Right . Eh , it was said that a Sudanese correspondent from al - Jazeera TV station , er , was arrested in Afghanistan and has been detained ever since at this , er , US military base at Guantanamo . Right . Yeah . We could say that the US has been suppressing al - Jazeera TV station for quite a long time . Yeah . Well , through what Ezzat said himself , he also thought he was innocent . Uh-huh . He basically also blamed it on the US . Well , will al - Jazeera TV station really sue US President Bush ? Will US President Bush have any occasion or opportunity to have this matter clarified ? Would you please analyze how this incident will develop next . I think that right now , it has actually entered into a certain judicial procedure in some sense . Uh-huh . That is to say , the British judicial authority has already brought charges against these two officials , er , suspected of disclosing secret documents . Uh-huh . Well , now we have seen that the director of al - Jazeera TV station has also flown to London to demand an explanation from Blair . Uh-huh . To bring up a lawsuit . Right? That is , I think that right now it is more likely to stay for a while as a topic of public commentaries . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . It will stay as a topic of public commentaries , because if the US indeed had such a plan , then , the freedom of speech it advocates will be again greatly discounted . Uh-huh .\n","\n","We know that the US , like the West , they made a lot of efforts in controlling the right of speech in the international mainstream media . This reminds me of the year 1999 . During the Kosovo war , the US blew up the radio station of , the former Yugoslavia . Uh-huh . It indeed blew up this radio station of Yugoslavia . Right . Then , later , the Westerners themselves , including the US , admitted that the reason why it won the Kosovo war was to a large extent that they won the other party in public opinion . Uh-huh . It seems that this incident will again lead to a public opinion war . Uh-huh . After this incident was exposed , ah , al - Jazeera , TV station issued a statement last week . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . The main idea of the statement was , eh , that al - Jazeera TV station has always followed the principle of impartiality , neutrality , and balance in news coverage . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . For that purpose , it is now seriously investigating the news about the US plan to bomb the al - Jazeera headquarters in reported by , ah , the British newspaper , and it hopes that the British government can explain this .'Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Right , it seems that this incident , as it develops , will have a lot of things worthy of our attention . However , as we are running out of time today , let 's end our discussion here . Thank you two very much for participating in our program . Thanks ! Uh-huh . All right , dear viewers , that 's all for today 's edition of Focus Today . Thank you for watching . Good-bye .\n","\n","Good evening , dear viewers .

Newsnight returns to duo action tonight. The co-hosts are Kira Phillips and Rick Sanchez. that 's Rick on the left Kira on the right. and they are in Atlanta. Double trouble. watch for the dolphins Larry. Carry on. I 'm told this guy in Miami saving is schula-esque your friend. Yeah not this year though. Well it might take a year. Good to talk . Go get them. Bye. Alright. Thanks Larry. Well tonight a Wal - Mart controversy. Good evening I 'm Kyra Phillips. And I 'm Rick Sanchez. Newsnight begins right now.\n","\n","Tonight every story has two sides. In Wal - Mart 's case both sides are being beamed onto big screens everywhere. One point three million people in America have decided it 's in their best self interest to work at Wal - Mart. Now are they stupid? No. I keep saying you ca n't buy small town quality of life at a Wal - Mart because they do n't sell it. But once they steal it from you you ca n't get it back at any price. Attention shoppers. is Wal - Mart 's way the wave of the future? And it 's a case of dueling realities. A city brimming with hope in some places devoid of it in others. New Orleans a tale of two cities. Also this man is a convicted murderer. Why are there so many who want his life spared? This is Newsnight.\n","\n","And we begin tonight with Wal - Mart a place no doubt many of you are likely to shop. When it comes to retail Wal - Mart is the biggest of the big. and that makes it a big target as well. Its corporate policies from buying cheap to selling cheap to providing jobs for tens of thousands of people while paying rock bottom salaries are also reasons it 's a big target. In fact right now Wal - Mart is the subject of not one but two documentaries about to be released one for one against. Two stories one giant store here 's a look. You drive up all the way up to New York City on Route 80. and you 'll see a Wal - Mart up on the hill. and then you 'll drive farther into the town. and you 'll see uh an empty town. Just looks like a neutron bomb hit it. It 's an explosive documentary that alleges Wal - Mart has a take no prisoners business philosophy that is good for profits but bad for America. They do n't get it. When we start talking about quality reliance they start talking about cheap underwear. At this point there 's something I should tell you. When you do a story on a film that 's as critical of a company as this one is about Wal - Mart I want to talk to that company Wal - Mart to get their reaction. Wal - Mart is not willing to go on camera. But it did provide us with a written statement saying quote like any company we want to make sure our associates customers and local community feel good about us. Wal - Mart makes life better for an awful lot of people by providing low prices and good jobs to those who need them. However we 're the first to admit we 're not perfect and have worked hard to make substantive business changes in areas where we fall short. Wal - Mart I think does n't do a good enough job telling its story. So who is speaking up for Wal - Mart? This man. But uh Wal - Mart has closed some businesses down. but it 's created others. In fact - In fact Ron Galloway is not only speaking up for the retail giant. he 's also producing a documentary in their defense one that depicts Wal - Mart as an ingenious business plan that is good for America. So many people have so many negative things to say about it. but what about the positive things ? While Galloway 's pro-Wal-Mart film introduces us to grateful employees - Somebody did it for me at a time in my life when I was totally hopeless. the anti-Wal - mart film points out that in two thousand one according to court documents workers made on average less than fourteen thousand dollars a year , that Wal - Mart 's CEO made twenty - seven million dollars a year. It also revealed that the owners of Wal - Mart the Walton family has an average net worth at or near one hundred billion dollars give or take a billion here or there depending on the price of their stock at the time. Now as for the workers or associates as they 're called by Wal - Mart their average salary is below what the government considers the federal poverty line. There were people I 'd see that did n't eat nothing. they 'd take an hour lunch and just sit there. This young mother that I talked to in LA was on Medi - Cal. she got on the Wal - Mart plan. she saw a doctor for the first time. The anti-Wal-Mart film depicts Wal - Mart as consumed with keeping wages and benefits down and unions out by flying in executives and installing cameras to monitor employees as soon as there 's a hint that workers may be organizing. The retail giant gets most of its merchandise from outside the United States in places like Honduras and Bangladesh where according to the film workers make as little as fifteen cents an hour and work seven days a week. but by far the largest provider of goods to Wal - Mart is China. How much does Wal - Mart depend on China? Company officials announced that in two thousand four they imported more than eighteen billion dollars in goods from the People 's Republic. I think Wal - Mart is a straw man for a set of issues that a certain group of people special interests groups have to deal with in American society. Now this is important. Officials making the anti uh Wal - Mart film say the film is not paid for with union dues. We asked. Also Galloway making the pro-Wal-Mart film tells me that he 's received no money and little support in fact from Wal - Mart itself. In fact Wal - Mart has no plans at this time to even carry his video in the stores. Kyra? Well whatever it does Wal - Mart always seems to be under a microscope. Why? Because a company that big that profitable is often imitated by other companies and that may well affect your benefits and your career. Take health care for example. A Wal - Mart internal memo recently leaked spelled out just how far the retail giant may be willing to go to keep its health costs low. The question is will other companies follow suit and how might that affect you. Here 's CNN 's Tom Foreman.\n","\n","Out in the morning rush of Washington DC like six out of ten Americans Tim Kane gets health insurance through his job. I think my hands are tied. I have to go through my employers. But as an economist at the conservative Heritage foundation Tim supports an idea that might put other commuters into shock.

Americans should understand that they would be much better off if businesses were n't providing them health care if they could buy it on the free market cheaply. This is controversial stuff. Wal - Mart with more than one point two million American workers is being criticized right now over a leaked company memo that suggests health care costs should be better contained. Wal - Mart Watch is a new advocacy group funded in part by labor unions to keep an eye on how the economic giant is shaping American life. I think that Wal - Mart today as we speak is attempting to change uh health care for the American worker to the worse. And you 're saying that affects all of us whether or not we work for Wal - Mart. When Wal - Mart makes a change in the way they do their business um then other businesses follow. Wal - Mart told us in a written statement it is expanding and improving its health insurance program. but it adds every business is asking the question how do we balance the genuine desire to provide the best benefits while remaining competitive in the global economy? That 's the catch. The United States is a rarity among nations in firmly tying health insurance to jobs making it a cost of doing business. So how did it get that way? Blame it on World War Two when fear of inflation prompted President Roosevelt to freeze wages. With so many Americans going to battle businesses were frantic for workers. So instead of more money they offered health insurance. Healthy employees are undeniably better for business better for society. but is that Wal - Mart 's responsibility? Look. this is a private company. What business is it of yours how they do their business? We the taxpayers are paying for Wal - Mart to profit. um and so therefore we have a say. And you believe that gives you a say. We 're stockholders. We 're shareholders in the company. A study before Congress last year said less than half of Wal - Mart employees were fully covered by the company insurance and that a significant number secure their health care from publicly subsidized programs. George Miller from California authored that report. I do n't think that Wal - Mart either has built an acceptable system for real health care for employees and they have n't really provided much to the national debate on how we can accomplish this uh as a nation. The debate over how workplace health insurance might fade and what might replace it is not just about Wal - Mart. And Wal - Mart 's trying to stay out of that mess. and it 's a very tricky problem. But when a company that big even whispers change these days everyone listens. That was CNN 's Tom Foreman reporting. Rick?\n","\n","And we continue the theme now. Andy Serwer works for us here at CNN and for Fortune Magazine. Andy 's one of the few journalists who 's profiled the Walton family. That 's why he 's the perfect guest to talk about Wal - Mart. Andy thanks so much for being with us again. Good to see you. you know you wonder. You know the Waltons. At what level will this affect them? They 're about to get hit with a whole lot of bad pub. Well you know in some senses Rick they 're used to it by now. I mean this is a company that 's come under attack for really the past ten years in a big way from labor unions from people in small towns from people in big towns. But this time it 's going to be in churches. it 's going to be in small gathering places in middle America with people saying some pretty horrible things - Do n't your feelings get hurt. or are they at a different level if your employees come out and say I ca n't feed my kids. I 'm not making enough money. you 're not giving me enough benefits. you 're not paying me for my overtime work. Well I think the Walton family does take it personally. I mean their name is on the door. Their father Sam Walton started this company. They do n't like the bad publicity. but they also feel wronged. They do n't believe a lot of the charges are true. and they are really starting to fight back. And we 're seeing articles describing how they 've really rallied and brought tremendous efforts to bear opening up offices in Washington and state capitals. They have a war room where they review all the criticism. and they try to respond now. But let me ask you this as I 'm sure people at home are sitting there thinking right now about their own job. if Wal - Mart is right and their model is right is this the way we 're going to go? Will other workers feel like perhaps their compensation packages their wages are going to be perhaps either trimmed down or worse as they allude to in this documentary? Well you 're talking about a race to the bottom in terms of compensation and benefits for American workers. And you 're seeing this happening at Wal - Mart. but you 're also seeing this happen at big manufacturing companies. Do n't forget people at Delta people at GM people at Delphi are getting their wages and salaries cut too and that does n't have anything to do with Wal - Mart. Having said that Wal - Mart is the biggest employer in the country. so they 're sort of the benchmark company the company that other companies look to like GM in the past and like a US Steel. So I think other companies are looking at what Wal - Mart is doing and saying you know , what is the new wage and pay scale in this country? But Wal - Mart is really the king of the bottom line , are n't they? They are. They really know how to make things out of nothing. and the person who 's really benefiting is the consumer who goes in there and gets a sweater for four bucks. Well and that 's what they say Rick. I mean one point three million Americans work at Wal - Mart. A lot of people like working there. We have to remember that. I mean it 's not all these people who work there are unhappy. That 's number one. Number two the Wal - Mart people say look. we 're paying people one point three million Americans. but hundreds of millions of Americans are benefiting from low prices. They 're able to buy a VCR they might not be able to buy because we 're keeping our costs low. That 's their response. If their message is right why are n't they putting one of their big kahunas out there to talk to Rick Sanchez to talk to Andy and say look , this is all wrong? Right now they 're not talking. they 're not willing to go on camera. Well they 're just starting to. You have to remember this company was a very closed uh culture really founded by Sam Walton. He passed away in nineteen ninety - two. He did n't believe in talking to the press. He did n't believe in PR. He said all we need to do was open stores up and offer goods at low prices. They 're starting to realize that they need to respond more and more. So they 're just getting up to speed. but I think you 're right. They should get out there and tell their side of the story. Is this going to be a big hit for them? No I do n't think it is going to be a big hit because there 're other things out there. You know there 's a negative documentary film about Wal - Mart. There 's maybe a positive film out there as well. They 're going to marshal their forces. and they 're going to fight back. and a lot of people like to shop at Wal - Mart. I mean they would n't be a problem to some people if they were n't so successful. People like to shop there. Certainly do. Time will tell. Andy thanks so much for being with us. You 're welcome Rick. And there you have it. Dueling documentaries out this month.\n","\n","Still to come on Newsnight the Big Easy suddenly split in two how people in the same city are living different lives two months after Katrina. We will take you there. Plus he 's a convicted killer a co-founder of a violent street gang. Now he 's on death row. So why are so many people trying to save his life?\n","\n","It is time now to check on some of the other stories that are happening tonight. and for that we go to uh Erica Hill from Headline News. Hello Erica. Hey Rick good to see you. We begin tonight in Iraq with a bloody end to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Twenty - seven people killed in three separate attacks today. The worst in a town forty - five miles south of Baghdad where a suicide bomber blew up a mini-bus in a busy shopping area. Elsewhere a US soldier was killed in an attack near Balad. and two Marines died in a helicopter crash near Ramadi. Bagram Afghanistan now where a senior al - Qaeda operative is apparently on the loose. Pentagon officials say Omar al - Farouq escaped from US custody back in July. Al - Farouq had set up the first al - Qaeda camps in southeast Asia. He was captured in Indonesia in two thousand two then turned over to US officials who brought him to Afghanistan. In Detroit Michigan thousands paying tribute today at the funeral of Rosa Parks. Many prominent figures were in attendance including the Reverends Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton as well as former President Bill Clinton. Parks inspired the Civil Rights movement of course when she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in nineteen fifty - five. She died last week at the age of ninety - two. And in Los Angeles a massive protest against the Bush administration shuts down parts of the city. The afternoon and evening demonstrations organized by the group The World Ca n't Wait led police to close many streets around a federal building in West LA. There were some confrontations with police. One officer 's uniform caught fire after a molotov cocktail was thrown his way. Quite the demonstration there Rick. Certainly looks like it. Erica thanks so much. We 'll look for you in just a little bit.\n","\n","Kyra? Well for more than two months we 've seen the havoc that Mother Nature can cause. We 've watched from our homes Katrina 's destructive force and people struggling in its aftermath. Even now it 's impossible to grasp the tragedy along the Gulf Coast. There are so many parts to it. So tonight CNN 's Dan Simon shows us a different angle a new divide forming in the Big Easy. It was the best of times. it was the worst of times. the famous words of Charles Dickens in A Tale of Two Cities. Here in New Orleans that nineteenth century text resonates as it feels literally like two cities have emerged since Hurricane Katrina one filled with anger and desperation - Nobody 's trying to help. Nobody 's trying to do nothing. But here across the river on what locals call the West Bank they have different problems the kind you do n't mind having like where to get coffee or go shopping. Here it 's about progress and optimism. The biggest complaint we have is we never know when the garbage is being picked up. Big deal right? Yeah. I mean you know so it 's all relative. Don and Joy Paolo live across the river from the devastation in a place called Algiers Point. We found the retired couple relaxing on their porch. Play on words. this is the West Bank. but people here call it the blessed bank. The Paolos bounced back quickly after evacuating to Ohio. While they came back to mold and a busted heater their problems seem miniscule. One of the biggest problems we have over here truthfully is traffic. There is no traffic in other parts of town. This is the devastated Lower Ninth Ward. Restaurants gas stations closed. neighborhoods vacant filled with trash. Contrast that with Algiers where carved pumpkins dot the landscape and most of the stores even little cafes are open for business. We just isolated. We like on a island over here. We isolated from the whole city. Daisy Peters 's feelings are understandable , her house in ruins. Other than the help of a few family members clearing away debris she 's on her own. I am very very very disgusted with this place. Who are you disgusted with? The governor and the mayor and FEMA and all of them. You feel like they just do n't care. I feel like they do not care. Government officials say they do care. but the magnitude of destruction makes rebuilding very difficult. There 's no drinkable water and little if any electricity here and no plan yet for restoring the neighborhood. I 'm not giving this house away. If somebody they do n't want to rebuild down here somebody need to see me about this house because I 'm not giving it to nobody. Daisy decides to take a rest. They 're also resting at the Paolo house but in a different way. Dan Simon CNN New Orleans.\n","\n","Whether you 've lost your entire home or just a few things a loss hurts. and one of our own here at CNN has felt the pain of Katrina. American Morning executive producer Kim Bondy has a house in New Orleans. American Morning anchor Miles O'Brien was with Kim today as she got some expert opinions on the damage to her home. This room was an addition to the house. It originally had paneling. and then when I bought the house in two thousand and one I had new walls put in. So this is all new drywall in here. So the mold growth is pretty substantial. The sunroom at Kim Bondy 's house in New Orleans sure could use a little sun. Perhaps it might bake away the multilayered mold that covers the walls and fouls the air. You 've got so much moisture in here. you know so much damage. the mold just feeds off of itself. Kim invited veteran property restoration expert Rusty Amarante to tour her once upon a dream home which sat in standing fetid water for two and a half weeks after the levees broke. Not a pretty picture. but Rusty Amarante has seen it all before. Would you recommend that a room like this be sort of torn down and start all over? I do n't think you need to tear it down. I think you need to thoroughly gut it. You need to take out. Gutting a house , stripping it to the bones like a Thanksgiving turkey seems like a bitter pill for the average homeowner. but Rusty has a way of putting things in perspective. Really you 're just talking about redoing the interior building envelope here. So uh as devastating as it is you 're really kind of fortunate because once you take out the plaster , once you take out the insulation make sure that the inside of the building is dry uh the foundation is dry you can really start the rebuilding process. And. But what about the structure of the house? Any osteoporosis in those bones? From what I can see of the brick from the outside it looks very solid. For some answers Kim called in another expert Elizabeth English a professor who studies how buildings weather hurricanes. Crawl space. Crawl space. I 've never even looked underneath there. But Elizabeth did. and it looks pretty good. Still a little damp down here. and that needs to dry out. Mhm. But um you know you do n't have a problem with rot at this point. It was a cursory inspection a few pokes and peeks. This is very good solid construction here. But enough to make Elizabeth a big believer in the Bondy bungalow. If this were your house what would you do? I 'd fix it up. Yeah? Absolutely. Absolutely. This house is not a goner. Uh this house can be uh repaired uh and brought back to life. and it 's bringing the individual houses back to life that 'll bring the neighborhood back to life. and bringing New Orleans ' neighborhoods back to life is what will bring the city back to life. Miles O'Brien CNN New Orleans hm. And you can catch American Morning 's Miles O'Brien and Soledad O'Brien every morning on American Morning beginning at seven am eastern. and you know just watching that piece I talked to friends of mine living in New Orleans saying they 're getting contractors to come out and give them estimates. One friend had three contractors come out. and the difference in prices. Yeah it 's amazing. it is amazing. You 've got to be really careful who you pick to take on the job. The waters have receded. but the problems have yeah. Keep rising.\n","\n","Tonight on Newsnight politics makes strange bedfellows. Would you believe that some liberal Democrats might support President Bush 's Supreme Court Nominee Samuel Alito? We 're going to explain this one to you. And why are so many people trying to keep a convicted killer from getting the death penalty? That story straight ahead.\n","\n","Ever since uh President Bush said the name Samuel Alito we have been hearing from both extremes of the political spectrum. The far right loves the Supreme Court nominee as you might imagine. The far left ca n't stand him. We 're learning though that some Democrats liberal Democrats are willing to give Alito a chance. CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley explains. Meet Jeffrey Wasserstein former law clerk for Judge Sam Alito. I think you look at the totality of his career and what you see is a judge squarely within the mainstream. Wasserstein is a liberal Democrat except when he votes Green party. and he is not alone. He 's hired liberals conservatives libertarians independents um. and all I know is that we 're all unanimously supporting the judge in his nomination. The kind of testimony that may make it easier for people like Senator Ben Nelson the third Democrat to get an up - close and personal look at the President 's Supreme Court nominee. A Democrat from Nebraska a state that went Bush in oh four Nelson is one of five red state Democrats up for reelection in oh six who would rather vote than fight. I just hope that we 're able to work our way through uh and make an up or down decision on this judge. He 's not even a member of the Judiciary Committee. but Nelson and other Democrats are targets of opportunity for the White House which hopes to pad Republican support for Alito with enough Democrats to discourage and if needed defeat a filibuster. No no no. Alito will not save Roe. Here 's the Democrats ' problem. The party 's base support liberal women 's groups civil rights groups environmental groups the footsoldiers that raise money knock on doors and vote come rain or shine want to fight over Alito. An argument that finds sympathy in blue state Democrats like Illinois 's Dick Durbin. It could tip the balance for a generation in another direction on critical issues women 's rights and workers ' rights the right of privacy uh protecting the environment human rights civil rights. All of these things are at stake in this nomination. The filibuster fight to please Democratic activists could alienate the kind of centrists who vote for both George Bush and Ben Nelson in the same state which is why the word filibuster makes Ben Nelson dance. You know the word filibuster keeps coming up in the questions rather than in the answers. but you do n't rule it out. but nobody 's ruling it in. While Democrats still hold out the possibility of a filibuster the competing need to please the base and reach to the center makes it hard to find consensus all of which could bode well for Sam Alito who may get by with a little help from his friends. There was never an ideological or political consideration in how he viewed cases. So a judge 's judge. Judge 's judge. Absolutely. Candy Crowley CNN Washington.\n","\n","The founder of one of the nation 's most notorious street gangs is facing a death penalty. Coming up , who 's trying to save his life and why? Also the survivors of that massive South Asian earthquake are facing a new and even deadlier if you can believe it threat. From around the world this is Newsnight. In a few weeks the state of California is planning to execute Tookie Williams the man who co-founded one of the country 's most notorious street gangs. You may have heard of the Crips or seen them portrayed in the movies. Well Williams is a convicted killer. but people all over the country are trying to save his life. CNN 's Chris Lawrence looks into why. Actor Jamie Foxx is asking California 's governor to spare the life of the man he played on screen. I never back down never. Stanley Tookie Williams co-founded the Crips street gang. He robbed and murdered and was convicted of his crimes in nineteen eighty - one. But from his cell on death row Williams spent years writing children 's books and preaching against gang violence. And if he dies some people are not going to have the opportunity to learn from his mistakes. Edgar Medina read the books and says Williams convinced him to stay in school. If I would have been in a gang right now I would 've probably be in jail dead. Instead he 's fifteen on track to graduate and go to college. I heard one report where they say he saved a hundred fifty thousand kids from joining gangs. That 's absurd. How do you know that? Retired sergeant Wes McBride worked the gang detail for twenty - six years in LA County. It 's not against the law to be a gang member. It 's against the law to kill people. and that 's what he 's convicted of. A witness says Williams robbed and executed a Seven Eleven employee then made fun of the man as he died. He was also convicted of gunning down an entire family father mother and daughter. Writing a few books does n't exonerate you from your crimes. In Williams ' case it wo n't. On December thirteenth he 's scheduled to die. I am at this time signing a warrant of execution. Williams 'books are a part of his legacy. so are the Crips. In thirty years the gang has spread from California to just about every state in the country. Fred Jackson works with kids who grow up surrounded by gangs. He says they really listen to Williams do n't tune him out like cops or counselors. To kill Stan will be throwing the baby out with the bath water. Jackson says executing Williams sends the wrong message. You would be telling gang members or those wannabe gang members do n't care how you turn your life around. once you are stuck you are stuck. No condemned murderer has been granted clemency in California since nineteen sixty - seven. The odds are against any man even one like Tookie Williams who was nominated for a Nobel Peace prize. But he did n't win it. You know and even if he did does that mean uh you 're forgiven for murdering a whole family? No I do n't think so. Like his life Tookie Williams ' legacy will be complicated. Chris Lawrence CNN Los Angeles.\n","\n","Well among those who believe Tookie Williams ' life should be spared is Lewis Yablonsky a criminologist expert in gang behavior and author of the book Gangsters. He joins us now live. Sir let me ask you why do you think Tookie should not die? Well I 've been studying gangs for fifty years. and we 're always looking for solutions. Uh here 's a man who has changed his lifestyle. I 've read all his books. He was significant in contributing some theories to my book uh Gangsters. and I think he can be a positive force in uh turning around young gangsters. In fact there 're several programs in the California Department of uh Corrections where uh ex-offenders some lifers are working with young offenders very effectively. Uh the Amity program uh in several prisons Phoenix program in several prisons. and uh I 've seen uh the impact of lifers individuals who are what I would refer to as experienced therapists. These are individuals who 've been there like Tookie. They 've gone through a transformation as he has over a period of twenty years. and they can have a real impact on some of the younger offenders to not go down their path and end up uh being executed. Well you know he writes in his memoir it was u- ha - He says daily he spent studying and questioning uh and soulsearching. He said he began to develop a sense of critical reasoning from which sprang the first stirring of +conscience. This was the moment when redemption infused itself into my life. You read this writing. and you think wow this is somebody who killed three people? Do you believe that murderers can be reformed? Is this man healthy? If he were to walk the streets again would he never kill again? we 're not talking about letting him out of prison. We 're talking about clemency to give him life without parole where we do n't kill him. And I have already made some uh efforts to put him into a particular program where he would uh be effective. One of the major gang problems uh of the insanity of gang problems is young black men killing young black men and Hispanic kids killing Hispanic kids. He talks a lot about black on black crime. Tookie - Right. And Tookie has come up with some interesting observations about why this goes on as - Uh they 're good enough to put in my theoretical book on gangsters. and I think he could be very effective in a program. and as I 've indicated I 've already talked to the director uh of a program in the California prison system. And if Governor Schwarzenegger really means what he says about uh the California Department of Corrections with emphasis on corrections and rehabilitation he should spare. But - He 's really the only one who can do it. and as I 've - Well Lewis let me ask you. let 's say he is granted clemency. what do you say to the victims ' families? Well we talk about redemption. We talk about forgiveness. Let 's put it this way. Uh twenty - five years ago I was a different person than I am now. I think Tookie Williams from my communications with him is a different person today than when we was convicted of these crimes. I 'm not uh excusing the crimes. and I 'm not necessarily uh against the death penalty. Uh some individuals perhaps should get the death penalty. but this is a man who can contribute to our society. and he can be effective. I know how police officers feel about it. but - I know. and you 've been studying this for more than thirty years. Lewis Yablonsky uh I thank you sir so much for your time.\n","\n","And we talked about family members. and Lora Owens is the stepmother of Albert Owens the convenience store worker that Tookie Williams was convicted of killing. She joins us now by phone. and I appreciate your time Lora. I want to take a moment to talk about Albert if you do n't mind and just uh remind us about his life. Okay. Go ahead Lora. Thank you for having me on. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to even speak about Albert. He seems to be the forgotten one. Unfortunately the Owens family studied gangs specifically the gang that Williams had because it affected our life. Do you have any idea the impact that it has had on the Owens family? See the picture of my son? We see him. That 's a man that went out. he wanted to make an honest living where Williams goes out to take whatever he wants. Now we have a major impact. Life 's different now because of what Williams did to the Owens family. Life 's a lot different. I do n't have to study gangs. I only have to study what Williams did. Is death - A big difference. Lora is death the answer? Does Tookie Williams need to die? Is that what would make you feel better would make your family feel better? It 's called closure Miss Phillips. That 's what it 's called because when someone like Williams can do all of these things - what has he paid? He does n't even say he 's guilty. He says he 's innocent. Alright so you have to do that with all of the appeals. He says he 's sorry. For what. that he did n't get away with it? He could do so much to stop gangs. He - Is he? No he does n't do any of that. What he does is find somebody who 's willing to write for him somebody who 's out there with the cause. Williams is n't the important one in this right to life cause. It 's the fact that it is a cause. and he 's got all of these people behind him. They have n't walked where the Owens family has walked. They have n't had to take someone who 's been murdered and try and build a life without them. Lora Tookie has this apology uh that he has written that of course he wants everybody to hear. Part of it says I pray that one day my apology will be accepted. I also pray that your suffering caused by gang violence will soon come to an end as more gang members wake up and stop hurting themselves and others. I vow to spend the rest of my life working toward solutions. Does that give you any sense of peace? He did n't write it to us. That 's not who he wrote that to. He wrote that to further his gang connections. That 's who he 's writing that to. He did n't write that to the Owens family. Lora Owens stepmother of Albert Owens we sure appreciate your time. I know this is a difficult uh period for you and your family. Um thank you Lora. Thank you very much.\n","\n","Well different perspective. We brought you the tale of two cities. and now we bring you a tale of two families. And it 'll be interesting to see what happens. There are a lot of people protesting and a lot of people that uh want to see him die. Still ahead on Newsnight winter is coming to the mountains of Pakistan. Will millions of those who survived last month 's massive earthquake now succumb to something else bitter cold? Also - The city of lights is aflame with torched cars. A frightening week of violence continues in Paris. Newsnight will return.\n","\n","Here 's a follow - up. High in the Himalaya Mountains tragedy is ready to strike once again. First it came in the form of a massive earthquake. Soon though it may be the freezing temperatures and the snow of a bitter winter that 's going to take a terrible toll. The number 's already brutal. Death toll eighty thousand by some counts and climbing. Another eight hundred thousand without shelter. not even a tent in some cases. More than two million in need of food. Many in mountain regions where relief trucks or even helicopters ca n't seem to get to. Now ITV 's Bill Neely reports. that 's just from the Kashmir region. that 's the area right between India and Pakistan. The helicopters are still busy here. but the weather is worsening. There are days they wo n't fly and places they wo n't go. Into one of these today came Save the Children driving a convoy of two hundred tents six thousand feet up into one of Kashmir 's most remote corners. There waiting hundreds of villagers. this aid the difference between life and death. One man at least has suffered enough death. Is seven kids one mom and one wife. He lost his seven children. Seven children. He lost his seven childrens plus eh his wife and eh his mom. Even the blind walked for hours across a mountain to get here. The tents blankets and clothes their only protection against a brutal winter. It 's a race here against time and against the heavy snows that are on their way. In about two weeks time these mountains and this valley will be covered in snow. and the logic of survival then is brutally simple. Anyone without shelter will die. The problem is there are n't enough tents here or anywhere else. so a second disaster that the UN says could kill thousands is n't just looming. it 's highly likely. These children survived the earthquake. Twenty thousand did n't. The coming cold and hunger could carry off thousands more. So they struggle away with their tents. and even the aid workers who 've been through the tsunami struggle to cope here. Logistically it 's the worst without a doubt. It 's getting high in mountains. The road that we came up now is pretty perilous to say the least. but we could get vehicles up. We 're talking about a lot of places have got no vehicular access whatsoever. Then we 're talking meal trains and helicopters. and we 're really running out of time. It 's quite a serious situation. the tsunami was much easier to deal with than this? The tsunami did n't have winter coming. I mean here we 've just got this hammer blow that 's going to come down very very shortly. The first disaster was an act of god. A second can be prevented by time. and aid money is running out. As we left night fell. and the first snow fell too. It did n't settle. but it will soon. Pakistan 's mountain people are braced for another terrible test. Bill Neely ITV News Naganari Kashmir.\n","\n","Well in a moment how sweet it is on the rise. but first we turn to Erica Hill in Atlanta with some other stories making headlines right now. Hi Erica. Hey Kyra good to see you tonight. We start off with a question many are asking tonight. could there have been a way out of the Iraq war before it started? A senior official from the United Arab Emirates tells CNN Saddam Hussein was ready to accept exile there to avoid war but then just days before war broke out , Saddam 's demands were not met and the deal fell through. In the troubled suburbs of Paris a seventh straight night of violence sparked by the accidental death of two teens. About one hundred eighty cars have been torched at this point. Police are hesitant to venture into the largely African and Muslim neighborhoods. but they have fired rubber bullets and tear gas at gangs of young people throwing stones. And finally tonight the world famous New York City Rockettes not kicking up their heels tonight. The precision dancers walked off the job at an evening dress rehearsal for the annual Christmas spectacular to support striking musicians. No word on whether or not they walked off in step. Oh have you seen those costumes by the way? They 're amazing. Oh I had to interview two of these beautiful women. and first of all they 're like six two. and the feathers are taller than fitting into this box. And heavy. Ew. Exactly. I do n't think I can be a showgirl. I ca n't pull it off. No you stick with what you 're doing. Thank you Erica. You two stop. Thanks Kyra.\n","\n","Still to come on Newsnight a sweeter than average story much much sweeter as we belly up to the bar the candy bar. Do n't get any ideas Rick. Got it. Got it. With Halloween on our minds you know what we thought of. We thought of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Duh dad as my daughter would say. To Dylan Lauren though who inherited a business smarts from her father that would be Ralph Lauren the film was a big screen candy coated business plan. That 's why she as you 'll see is now on the rise. Hi I 'm Dylan Lauren. And I am a candy lover. So I decided to take my passion and create the world 's largest candy store and fill it with candy and anything candy related. That 's what Dylan the Candy Bar is. It 's an homage to candy. I was inspired when I was younger by uh Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. And it 's a bunch of stores that have a sort of entertainment philosophy. And I just thought there 's not anything like that in the candy business that you know - FAO Schwartz had it with toys. or Niketown has it with sneakers. I thought would n't it be fun for even me who 's a candy freak to just walk in and have this like oversized emporium of oversized lollipops. I have four stores at the moment. I 'm hoping to open a good twenty more. The flagship 's in New York City. The other Dylan 's Candy Bars are in Houston Orlando and Roosevelt Field. Well this is my office. I 've always loved candy. At first it was about the taste. I love gummy bears and gummy fish. I just always started to look at candy 's packaging. And as an art history major I also was influenced by a lot of pop artists. This is our stripe which are on our bags and our logos. I really loved art and candy. Did you like the ones that we were talking about for the malls though? Our theme is to basically merge pop culture art fashion with candy and also to have like the largest assortment of colors and flavors. This is our body uh shake. It 's a milk bubble bath chocolate. We do n't just carry candy per se to eat. We have a spa product like chocolate bath powders and vanilla body moisturizers. We 're expanding into um our own Dylan 's Candy Bars spa line. Our customer is really the kid in the adult.  and it 's anyone. I think the candy store brings out the kid in everyone. And I definitely am. I do n't know. people do n't know how old I am. People think I 'm fifteen because I love candy and I love colors. But I have a mature sensibility about it too. But I think you have to have the sort of attitude of creativity and fun and anything is possible. Coming up a special hour of Newsnight winning the war on terror how other nations are fighting terrorism and what we in the US are learning from them. This is Newsnight.\n","\n","Well it has happened again. Even years later the names still raise a chill Paducah Jonesborough Columbine. Tonight a new town another boy. but the terror is just the same. CNN 's David Mattingly joins us now. David what 's happening? Anderson about a little after two o'clock today a fifteen year old student wielding a hand gun shot and killed an assistant prinicpal then badly wounded the principal and another assistant principal. and uh the suspect was taken into custody after he was subdued by staff here at the high school. He was taken to a hospital where he was treated for what appeared to be a gun shot wound to his own hand suggesting there might have been uh a struggle going on afterwards. But police here tonight are continuing to look for any bit of evidence that they can. As soon as this happened the school went into a lockdown. the students were not allowed to leave their classes. This went on for about two hours before they were finally let out and everyone was finally able to figure out what had happened here. So many people shocked and absolutely stunned by what happened. so many times we have heard today that I ca n't believe this happened in our small town. But this tragdey definitely has come to roost here after taking the life of a very popular assistant principal here Anderson . Uh this is Jacksborough Tennessee we 're talking about. how big a place is Jacksboro? Um not very big at all. In fact when I asked the sheriff exactly how many people were here he said he could n't really tell me that it 's just that he gave me the county at large but there were thirteen hundred students here at the school. This is the one big high school for this county. So not many people at all. Everyone knew uh the people at this school particularly this administrator and assitant principal Ken Bruce. Students tonight saying he was very well - liked very approachable the kind of teacher who would actually give you lunch money if you forgot to bring it with you that day. So they 're talking about him tonight. They 're going to be missing him very much in the future Anderson. About a little after two o'clock today a fifteen year old student wielding a hand gun shot and killed an assistant principal then badly wounded the principal and another assistant principal. And David do we know what time of day this happened? Shortly after two o'clock today it happened near the office of this school. In fact some witnesses at the office say it happened just right there next to them while they were there trying to conduct some business at the school. Uh police are still trying to figure out what led up to that , why the student was there at the office and what exactly transpired between him and the administrators before those shots were fired. All right appreciate that. I know you uh just got to the scene. Uh it 's going to be a long night and a long couple of days as we 're trying to piece together uh the information exactly what occured in those terrible moments before the shooting. Here 's where the story and the backstory really start coming together. It 's very much an involving process as David just said. The young man has spoked to the police but no one is saying what he said. There 's a closed crime scene out there tonight evidence still to be gathered people questioned statements taken. At some point the picture 's going to snap into focus tonight though we only have sketches.\n","\n","With us now from Jacksboro Tennesse Ethan Riggs who knows the suspect well and Ethan 's cousin Nathan Lawson who was at the school today. Uh guys I appreciate you being on the program tonight. You Nathan you were at the school when it all unfolded. What did you see? Well we could n't see anything because we were all in class. And I just heard about uh the student going into the office or around the office and shooting the prinicpal and the assitant principals that were there. and what happened? Uh you were in class. I mean how did they alert people what happenend? Well we were already in class. and Mr. Steele got on the intercom and told everyone that we were having a lockdown. And how long did the lockdown last for? Uh an hour and half two hours. Uh Ethan how long have you known the alleged shooter? I should just point out to our viewers we 're not using the young man 's name. Uh he 's underage. It 's policy and impolicy not to do that. Um how long have you known him? Well I knew him for a while back in elemetary school but not much uh from here for a while back. but back in elementary school he was an all - right person and hardly ever got into any trouble. Uh were you surprised to hear that he might be involved in a shooting? Yeah I was. Nathan how about you? did you ever think your classmate was capable of killing? No not really - uh he 's been in some trouble before but nothing like this. I would never think that he would do anything like this. Do you know what kind of trouble he had been in before? Well in middle school he got suspended for a year for stabbing Mr. Steele with a pencil. he stabbed somebody with a pencil? Yeah the principal. The principal okay. Uh now Nathan or Ethan I mean you know you hear these reports. teen shooters they 're often descibed as you know kids who have been picked on or bullied by peers. Uh was he that type? Was he a loner? Do you know did he get picked on? Well in elementary school he was never picked on. Like I said he had friends just like anybody else. Would n't say he was popular or anything. but everybody got along with him. Well it 's got to be just a bizarre day for you for both of you and a tragic day for your school. and I appreciate both of you being with us to talk about what you know. Thanks very much.\n","\n","I want to talk a little bit more now on why not why in this case because frankly we do n't know that and we do n't want to speculate , That 's unknowable but why in so many other cases because even though it is too soon to tell whether this one fits a pattern there is a pattern and we have seen it time and time again. Bitter experience has taught us that. Here 's CNN 's Heidi Collins. Columbine Springfield Pearl Red Lake Minnesota this past March and now Jacksboro Tennessee. It is a list that conjures up images of screaming children injured victims and gun - wielding kids. Different towns with tragically similar stories. What makes these young men snap. and what qualities if any do school shooters share? According to the FBI there are dozens of risk factors when it comes to school violence. but there is no one definitive profile of this type of criminal. Most often the perpetrator is a white male age eleven to eighteen who was described as feeling picked on or bullied by his peers. We allow boys to be angry and aggressive. but we do n't allow them to express fear and sadness and other more vulnerable emotions. so hence when they get rejected or they get disappointed they have a harder time dealing with that. and it often comes out in anger. Most of the shooters like you see in this video of Dylan Clebold and Eric Harris from Columbine High School had a fascination with firearms or violent video games. And while there were signs or warnings about their intentions they were not taken seriously at the time. The sheriff 's department did n't respond to our um reported threats by Eric Harris against our son for thirteen months. Columbine would not have happened if they had investigated that to begin with. Classmates say Clebold and Harris who brought terror to Littleton Colorado in nineteen ninety - eight and Jeff Weiss the Red Lake Minnesota teen who killed nine people and wounded seven before fatally shooting himself all wore dark trenchcoats and were fans of Marilyn Manson. Kip Kinkel who killed two students in Springfield Oregon was a fan of Manson 's music as well. According to the FBI all of the shooters may have felt the desire to defend narcissitic views of themselves and had very low self - esteem. Luke Woodham killed two students in Pearl Mississippi. Well I guess you all start remembering me now. I 'm probably going to get pretty famous. Famous for two things that seem to unite all of these young men no one believed they were capable of committing such horrible acts and no one was able to stop them. Heidi Collins CNN New York. We hear that over and over again. I never expected they could do such a thing.\n","\n","Still ahead tonight more late election returns more races that could affect you more questions about how this affects the president and his party. Also ahead in Rwanda a country rocked by genocide ten years ago let 's see how it 's affecting the animals still to this day. Around the country and the world this is Three Sixty. Uh you know no matter where you stand politically it is tough to dispute the president 's good fortune. Though battered in the polls this is an off - year for House and Senate races. There are a number of races however being decided tonight. and as they count the votes across the country we 'll be giving you the latest on those races which may have national overtones as well. Joining us now is CNN 's John King and Jeff Greenfield. Uh let 's start with John King from DC with breaking news on the election results. John what 's the latest? Well Anderson the democrats are celebrating in the two biggest races tonight. Those are the races for the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey. CNN projecting that Tim Kaine currently the lieutenant governor will be the next governor of the state of Virginia. Tim Kaine a democrat winning in Virginia a state President Bush carried a year ago. And in New Jersey another democratic victory. John Corzine currently a member of the United States Senate will be the next governor of New Jersey according to CNN projections. One republican victory tonight. That is in New York City. Mayor Michael Bloomberg the Associated Press projects will be re-elected as the mayor of New York City. A democrat turned republican. so that a frustrating race for the democrats. but democrats will celebrate those two state - wide victories Virginia of course the most significant. President Bush carried that state a year ago. He campaigned for the republican candidate just last night an election eve appearance. Democrats will certainly make the case that the president 's troubles are continuing in the state of Virginia. I will say though Anderson I think the bigger national question out of the state of Virginia might be that this helps the current incumbant governor Mark Warner. He is leaving office and thinking about running for president. His party 's strength there tonight will only encourage that. Jeff any surprises to you? No uh the most startling thing which we do n't often talk about is the sheer amount of money that these people have. Mike Bloomberg is a five billion dollar man who threw seventy million dollars into this campaign. There were ads in Cantonese and Russian. He won a landslide. I 'll cross the river. John Corzine 's worth about three hundred million defeated Doug Forrester a piker only worth about fifty million dollars though it was a combined campaign of about fifty million dollars. Mark Warner who John King just talked about has a personal wealth of two hundred million. and later tonight when we go to California the gentleman named Schwartzeneggar who has about a hundred million dollars threw millions into his big successful effort at governor. But can the democrats really crow about what 's going on in Virginia and what 's going in New Jersey? Well they will. um and they won uh and in Virginia particularly. Virginia was one of the first southern states to go republican. I think Nixon carried it in nineteen sixty. It is significant when a democrat succeeds a democrat not just because it gives Mark Warner talking points but it is a crimson red state. Do we want to make too much of it? No we do n't. John King uh Arnold Schwartzeneggar 's not on the ballot. but eh some of his critics say he really with some of these ballot initiatives. Uh when do the polls close there? The polls close eleven o'clock eastern out in California. and to follow up on the point Jeff just made about perhaps not overstating the impact for the president I think one of the things we will watch closely tonight is that some of the polls are showing that the American people are a bit testy shall we say um not patient anymore with all of the politicians. And that of course would affect the republicans more because they are in power in Washington controlling the presidency and the Congress. Whether they take it out on Governor Schwartzeneggar in California could be another test of that as well. Jeff. One quick point. the election that mattered for next year has already happened that special election in the Ohio congressional district with Cincinatti a republican district. Former Iraqi war combat veteran I guess he is a present veteran Paul Hackett came within four points of beating the republican in a district that no democrat has come close to carrying. That 's the one that 's giving the republicans willies for next year. All right Jeff we 'll join you later. John King as well thanks very much .\n","\n","Still ahead on Three Sixty a family torn apart on whether to let their son die. A case that may be heading where Terri Schiavo 's did. A fifteen year old boy at the center of it all. And in a corner of the world where genocide claimed nearly a million lives a new struggle between man and beast. Around the world and across America this is Three Sixty. In a moment a life and death struggle over a fifteen year old boy who is in a coma uh who is lying breathing on a ventilator. The fight is between two parents who are divorced over what to do about their son.\n","\n","But first a check of the day 's headlines. Here 's CNN 's Erica Hill in Atlanta. Hey Erica. Hey Anderson we begin tonight in Jacksboro Tennessee where police say a student opened fire on a principal and two assistant principals in an office in a high school. One of the assistant principals was killed , another critically wounded. In Iraq the foreign military occupation of that country is authorized at least through December of two thousand six. That 's because today the UN Security Council voted to extend the mandate that allows some one hundred fifty - seven thousand US troops twenty - two thousand troops from other countries to operate there. The Iraq provisional government requested the extension. In Australia supporters of alleged terror suspect with TV reporters shouting stay away. Australian authorities say they prevented a terrorist attack through their undercover work. Seventeen people were arrested. Officials said they moved in because the alleged plot had passed the planning stage. Meantime a very different crowd reaction in Salem Oregon where two couples in - laws who invested forty dollars in lottery tickets had their claim certified today in the second biggest payout in US lottery history. Three hundred forty million smackers. Talk about a little bit uh of love to share around the family there. But Anderson sounds like they 're going to lead a very normal life. They 're saying may not even get that many more presents under the tree this Christmas. Wow man I hope so. You know hear all these horror stories about how people react. and let 's just hope they sock it away and save it up for their kids or something. I know. Erica thanks. We 'll check in with you a little bit later.\n","\n","You know it 's hard to think of a more agonizing decision that a parent could face choosing whether to let a child die or to hold out hope no matter what the doctors and all the other experts say. Usually these horrible decisions are made in private. sometimes unfortunately they divide an entire country. The sad case of Terri Schiavo not only tore her family apart. it really re-ignited a debate as thorny as it is heartbreaking. The case of Jansen Jones is just as complicated and equally heartbreaking. CNN 's Rick Sanchez from Bountiful Utah with more.  Rick? Yeah thanks so much Anderson. This is the new facility where uh Jansen Jones is going to be staying from now on. His father decided that he should be here. Uh this is what we know about his case. He was probably unable to breathe accoding to his parents and experts who have talked to him for about twenty minutes. Now we 've talked to medical experts about this situation. and they tell us if a fifteen year old goes without oxygen for fifteen to twenty minutes , what results is usually severe and irreparable brain damage. Here now is Jansen 's story. You 're not supposed to have a heart attack when you 're only fifteen years old. I 'll never forget the morning that uh I got the news. The news was grim. Margaret 's little boy with the likeable smile and the dimple cheeks had experienced full cardiac arrest. What 's worse it happened on this dark street corner one morning while riding his bike to school. He was all alone no mom no dad no help until finally he was spotted by a paramedic on her way to work. When we found him he was um still on his bike. um and his head was um against cement. Jansen Jones was rushed by helicopter to the hospital. Did you think he would be able to pull through? I had faith. But then doctors showed Margaret her son 's MRI test and explained to her what results when the brain is deprived of oxygen. Does he blink? No. Does he make any sounds? No. Nothing. Nothing. Are you convinced that he is in fact brain - dead? Yes I am. Margaret made a decision after talking to hospital officials here at the University of Utah that she would take her son off of life support. She made the decision though not based solely on science or even her own observations. She tells us she made the decision based on her Christianity her faith. And you do n't think that God would want you to have your son continue in the condition he 's in now? No. You 're convinced of that. Yes. But God is also the reason Margaret 's ex-husband Jansen 's father gives for his decision to keep the boy on life support. He needs to be given a chance to live. Also a devout Christian John Jones has little faith in what doctors tell him. Doctors have been wrong before and misdiagnosed.  I do n't agree with him at all. In fact when asked you think letting him go is the Christian thing to do , She says- Yes I think so. While he says - I believe in a living God. and I believe that uh you can still perform miracles as you want to call them. Two parents one God and one life or death decision that may end up being settled in a court of law. Rick how could this wind up in the courts? Well here in the state of Utah because the father had custody of the child they 've been divorced now for uh three years he would be able to make the decision. However if the mother decides that she wants to take him to court to see if her decision is allowed all the folks in this uh state that I have talked to who 've dealt with matters like this in the past say that judges usually allow the evidence to be heard from both sides. That would mean Anderson what you would have is another court battle as you alluded to earlier similar to the Schiavo case. All right Rick Sanchez in Bountiful. Thanks very much Rick. You know it 's been more than seven months now since Terri Schiavo 's life came to an end. She died March thirty - first thirteen days after her feeding tube was removed. Up to that point we got to know Schiavo 's parents and her husband fairly well as their fight played out all too publicly on television. Since Terri 's death they have n't been seen much on the national stage. but their battles go on. Tonight in a new segment we 're calling Memory Lapse we take a look at what the family is doing right now. Teri 's husband Michael is back in the news making a splash in politics far from home by endorsing the candidacy of democrat Tim Kaine for governor of Virginia in tonight 's election. Michael Schiavo spoke out against politicians intervening in family affairs. He 's also been busy writing about his side of the battle over his wife. He and author Michael Hirsch are colloborating on a book titled Terri the Truth. It 's scheduled to be released in March. and that will once again put him at odds with Terri 's parents whose still untitled memoir will be released that same month. The Schindlers ' book will share their struggle to keep Terri alive a story they 've been through speeches and public statements. Last week at a convention in Omaha Nebraska Bob and Mary Schindler called Terri 's death quote judicial homicide and hinted that euthanasia advocates may have been behind it. The Schindlers also have been fighting the right to die movement through the Terri Schindler Schiavo foundation. No doubt when those books come out we 'll be hearing about this case for quite some time to come. \n","\n","Still to come on Three Sixty , it 's unlike anything you 've ever seen before. Animal expert Jack Hannah takes us to a place where people and wildlife try to co-exist a place where both share a horrific past. And later a new look at your sex life a new survey is out the most extensive they say in fifty years. See how you may compare to some others out there. Stay with us.\n","\n","A little bit more than a decade ago in the central African nation of Rwanda something unspeakable happened. Genocide though the US refused to call it that at first. Eight hundred thousand people at least women men and children were brutally killed hacked to death stabbed thrown into rivers. Today the genocide 's effects are still haunting both the survivors and the wildlife in Rwanda. You see many of those who fled some of them settled in an animal refuge. Renown wildlife advocate Jack Hannah director of the Columbus Zoo recently went to Rwanda to see how the people and animals are co-existing. Rwanda this breathtakingly beautiful land is soaked in blood the people living with the pain of their history. Akagera National Park once a spectacular wildlife refuge is now a refuge to many Rwandans who survived the genocide and returned to their native land trying to start life anew. There are so many people in Rwanda now they 've taken over two - thirds of the national park. And because of that Rwanda now faces a problem. What will happen to the wildlife? How will the animals co-exist with humans? That 's what Jack Hannah the renown wildlife advocate wanted to find out as he went in search of wild elephants. There 's said to be eighty elephants in Akagera. but for Hannah and his crew finding even one was not unlike looking for that proverbial needle in a haystack. Now the elephant 's back that way , right? Hannah hired a boat to take him to a fishing village where there had been reports of a male elephant. They search for hours and hours. and finally - Oh yeah I see it. But even a wildlife expert like Hannah was surprised to find such a mighty creature submerged in lake water. It was very unusual behavior. Look at that. he 's like a submarine. he 's going to use his trunk . Whoa look at that. look at him move tha - He is going fast. That is fast. Big elephant. An estimated eleven feet tall , weighing perhaps fourteen thousand pounds the mature bull elephant was as big and angry as any they'd 'd seen before. And he started to pursue them. That is fast. Remember elephants can swim everybody. And they got like a periscope. I do n't know if he 's walking or swimming. but he 's moving. Hannah and his crew beat it to shore and to safety not realizing that in April the US embassy in Kigali had issued a warning to American tourists about a rogue elephant charging visitors. your trunk go like this. On shore Hannah was greeted by local kids. Trunk. that 's it . that 's it. And in exchange for his kindness they shared a little known secret about the rogue elephant. Turns out this monster of the deep was in fact an old friend of the children 's. and to prove it they lured him in with sweet words and sweet potatoes. Thank you so much. thank you. thank you. that 's something else. That 's all I can tell you. Akagera National Park may not be all that it once was. nor of course is Rwanda. but Jack Hannah says that there is a sense of healing and as in the mighty steps of elephants there are small steps being made towards recovery.\n","\n","Had you ever seen behavior like that in elephants? No not in a while. Uh when I saw the kids doing it I went up there. and I said I ca n't believe this big bull elephant a wild bull elephant. But the kids had you know - animals know people. and he knew no harm in that village. and they actually were taking care of it. and of course when he went in the musk I guess he tipped over a jeep or two and you got to be careful when that happens. We 're going to take a quick break. and then we 'll be back with uh Jack Hannah. A lot more uh coming up tonight on Three Sixty. Stay with us. Before the break we went to Africa with renown wildlife advocate Jack Hannah director of the Columbus Zoo. He took us to a region of Rwanda where those who survived the genocide of eleven years ago or ten and a half years ago are living side by side with wildlife. We showed you the huge elephant he encountered. and that was n't all he saw. Jack Hannah joins me now once again to show us exclusive footage of the mountain gorillas he visited. Uh we were just talking about Rwanda. I 've been there a lot over the years uh and have visited these gorillas. It 's the most incredible animal viewing I think on the planet. At least for me. Yeah not just the viewing. it 's the experience Anderson of being there. It 's just people do n't realize they can all do it as well. Uh this last year in tourism increased sixty - seven percent in Rwanda. And the gorilla population under President Kagame has increased seventeen percent. One of the only countries in Africa where animals are really increasing as far as population. \n","\n","And I mean some of the footage that we 're showing now is footage that you shot. and it 's incredible. You and anyone can go . a tourist can go and as long as they you know do it respectfully can go and sit with these gorilas just as you are. Exactly right. Right there. one hour. and of course you 're not allowed to approach them. they approach you. and that 's what you see here. these animals uh uh approach you. Now this is one actually that was uh uh taken uh out of the wild and brought to a veteranarian 's place right there below uh you know where the gorillas are. That 's a lowland gorilla is what you 're seeing there uh one that was brought - and of course we just ca n't put it back out in the wild yet. Uh the mountain gorilla as you know are the ones with the much longer hair live up about eight thousand feet. It 's where you went to visit. Yeah I went there on vacation this summer. and it 's just incredible. There they are right there. They 're climbing all around you. they literally brush by you at times. What are the similarities to humans? I mean everyone always says how you know much like humans they appear. Well well the similarities are it 's a family structure. and you watch the four and three and four years old play with the little uh eight to ten week old babies you know when their mother might let them go away just a little bit. Right. and you see the proctection. they 're not a King Kong type of animal. And the neat thing about it is there will be a web camera up there. Uh John Dick has got the tower up there so people can click on it within a year from now and watch the gorillas in the wild. No kidding really? Be unbelieveable. That 's amazing. Unbelieveable. Wow eh the genocide I mean it permeates everything still in Rwanda. I mean Kagame has done a remarkable job with the country. Um I mean how has it impacted on the animals? Well uh uh a lot of the refugees came back in. Some of them got into the parks. but now what he 's done , he 's protected those parks where no one absolutely nobody 's allowed to go inside the park boundaries now. Uh the gorillas are coming back seventeen percent. tourism is up. as I said Lake Akagera National Park is incredible. they even now have the habituation of chimpanzees. I just was one of the first people to go there. and so you can go to one of the only countries in Africa and see the chimpanzees in the wild as well as the gorillas.\n","\n","You also worked with a woman uh Rosamond Carr who runs an orphanage. and you have some video uh of what she has done. Oh gosh. She 's been there uh for years and is a legend in that country. For about forty - five years. Uh she 's a remarkable lady. Yeah she really is. We 've given the Columbus Zoo and al - With Partners of Conservation we 've raised almost one point four million dollars for the orphanage as well as the artisans women with the artisans that do the baskets and the beekeepers. so we 're uh teaching people how to have productive lives in Rwanda. This is her right here. and these are the kids by the way in the old orphange. and now she 's moving them up to her home in the mountains about an hour out of Kasenji as you well know on the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo. And what we did , we brought all sorts of things for the orphans there incredible incredible children. And these are kids whose parents were killed in the genocide. Exactly. and by the way it 's all one Rwanda right now as we were talking. no Tutsis and Hutus anymore. President Kagame said it 's all one Rwanda , we all are together now . it 's interesting because you go there and people are offended if you ask are you Hutu or are you Tutsi. Exactly. Because eh they do n't want those divisions. No they do n't want those divisions. and yet they all live together. and you would think that they would have that division. but you sure do n't have it. you have a tremendous love there. and by the way it 's probably now the cleanest country I 've ever seen in Africa. I could not believe what I s- And the road system is incredibile. they 're good. what 's amazing too is you go to see the gorillas and you start talking to the guides who are taking you up and you ask them did you lose anyone and they will just turn and without blinking an eye tell you you know all my family is gone. Yeah we had a guide do the same exact thing. and we said where 's your family. and he said I lost my dad and then goes right along and talks to his buddy who might be a Hutu or a Tutsi. and so- but they never ever mention that uh whatsoever. But I think it 's the greatest turnaround of any country in the world in the last eh ten years. And the gorillas are coming back , are n't they ? I mean they 're /- Oh yeah seventeen percent increase. and of course Rwanda has about three hundred and seventy , right. Uganda has about another three hundred. So you 're talking about a species that is very very vital as far as their numbers are concerned. You know if somebody got a cold up there like the veterinary project 's doing a great job up there right now uh you would have a disaster up there. so that 's why people ca n't have colds if they go up and visit the gorillas that type of thing. Uh Jack it 's always good to see you. I 'm glad uh you spent so much time in Rwanda. and I 'm glad you talk as fast as I do. Oh yeah I do. I got a little cottage over there. so I 'm going to be spending a lot of time over there. Well you 're doing great things for the country. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.\n","\n","Uh we 've got a lot ahead tonight on Three Sixty. Horrible case of deja vu. another deadly school shooting. this time in Tennessee. We 're going to have the latest on this developing story. Uh also why some are calling the riots in France that country 's Katrina problems long in the making that the violence has now revealed. And a report card well on our collective sex lives. Jack you want to stick around for this the biggest study since the Kinsey report they say. So How much have we changed in our habits in the last fifty years? You actually can get your questions answered about this- You can call us at one eight seven seven six four eight thity - six thirty - nine that 's one eight seven seven six four eight thirty - six thirty - nine or email us by going to our website CNN dot com slash Three Sixty. We 'll put your questions to some experts. Welcome back to the second hour of Three Sixty. We know that women are essential. but are men even necessary? I 'll talk to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd about her latest book. Also the latest details in the fatal school shooting. Second hour of Three Sixty starts now. Should torture be banned during interrogations? The White House says the ban is n't necessary. but without it some fear the military will go too far. I 'd stick a knife in somebody 's thigh in a heartbeat. Plus let 's talk about sex. The biggest study on America 's collective sex life in fifty years. and you wo n't believe the results. We 're taking your calls. This is Anderson Cooper Three Sixty. Live from the CNN studios in New York here 's Anderson Cooper. Thanks very much for joining us.\n","\n","Let 's look at some of the other stories that are making headlines right now. At this moment a fatal school shooting in uh Jacksboro Tennessee leaves an assistant principal dead. No students were injured. Authorities are holding a fifteen year old in the attack. The school 's principal and a second assistant principal are hospitalized with serious wounds. Another CIA leak probe may be in the works. This time the question is who told The Washington Post that the CIA is operating prisons in Eastern Europe. Republican congressional leaders have asked for an investigation. To Baghdad now. another defense attorney in Saddam Hussein 's trial is murdered. A second co-defendant 's lawyer was gunned down. The killings are raising questions about whether the trial will resume as scheduled on November twenty - eighth. Indiana now. the mobile home park residents who survived Sunday 's deadly tornado will be allowed back to the area tomorrow. Authorities put the official death count at 22 people in two Indiana counties.\n","\n","Back to Jacksboro Tennessee now where tonight Campbell County Comprehensive High School is a crime scene the site of today 's deadly school shooting. CNN 's David Mattingly joins us with the latest on the investigation. David? Anderson some new information for you at this hour. We 're hearing from Knoxville the principal Gary Seal and assistant principal Jim Pierce are both out of surgery at this hour. Both of them are now listed in serious condition. These are the two survivors of this shooting. A third assistant principal Ken Bruce was killed as a fifteen year old student opened fire with a handgun near the school offices. That happened a little after two o'clock today. and as you might be able to see behind me with all the flashing blue lights the investigation still underway. We have also learned that at this hour investigators have questioned others as to where this young man was able to get a gun and how he was able to get it into the school questioning others to find out if others might have been somehow connected to this case. But at this point most of the investigation is going on inside the building collecting every possible piece of evidence that they can. The suspect is in custody at a juvenile detention facility. He was taken there after being treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to his hand. Investigators are being very careful about how they say uh this all came about. Uh they 're not willing at this point to put any sort of A B and C sequence together. Uh there are some people who knew this young man who say that he was troubled. but authorities will not confirm what was going through his mind or what was happening as this shooting occurred. Anderson? David we 've spoke uh in the last hour to a young man who knows uh this young man who 's now in custody who said that he had been suspended previously for a year for stabbing an assitant principal with a pen or a pencil. Do you know anything more about that? Uh authorities will not talk about that tonight. Uh we 're hoping that they will shed more light on that tomorrow. but we are hearing that story from multiple students. We 're not sure if it 's all part of the rumors that go around after these type of incidents do occur. but there seems to be some certain credibility in the widespread belief that uh this student did have problems the year prior and had problems uh as he came back to this high school. And David we 're looking at pictures now of the suspect being put into a police car. I do n't know if you 've seen the pictures. Is that blood on his shirt? That is blood on his shirt. Again he was treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to his hand suggesting that he might have been wounded himself during whatever struggle that occurred after these shootings. Authorities tell us that he had been subdued by the time the first responders arrived here so that he was subdued by staff here at the school. After all that happened the school was in lockdown. the students were locked in their classes for about two hours. They were released uh to some very anxious parents here outside the school grounds. The school is going to be closed for the rest of the week Anderson .There will be counseling here going on for anyone who needs it. and that goes for not just the students but the staff here as well. All right David thanks good reporting. As David it is an active investigation and crime scene as you can see very much uh still an active crime scene.\n","\n","Uh if we had to pick a single thing to underscore how completely life has changed in this country since nine eleven it might be the fact that there are now arguments serious ones not only against but also for torture. Never was a debate about this subject before. now there certainly is. CNN 's Tom Forman has been investigating. If you could save the life of a soldier rescue the hostage children stop the next terrorist bomb by torturing a prisoner for information would you do it ? I 'd stick a knife in somebody 's thigh in a heartbeat. Retired general Spider Marks a CNN consultant worked for US army intelligence teaching interrogation techniques. The kind of enemies we 're fighting have no sense of right or wrong. They will go to any depths to achieve their ends. Do we have to go with them? we do n't need to go with them. we need to preclude them from going there. And that might include some use of torture in order to prevent it. Polls have shown that more than sixty percent of Americans think it can sometimes be justified. But here 's the catch. Experts including General Marks are convinced with the vast majority of prisoners it just does n't work. It does not give you credible accurate timely inactionable intelligence. Mark Jacobson a former defense department official outlines the troubles. You need to know a prisoner has critical information. the prisoner must be succeptable to torture. and oh by the way when people are tortured , when people endure physical pain they 're going to seek to stop that as quickly as possible. If I torture you you 're going to tell me exactly what I expect to hear. The White House under fire over reports of secret CIA prisons overseas says torture is not allowed. But - We are going to do what is necessary to protect the American people. We are also going to do so in a way that adheres to our laws and to our values. Uh we have made that very clear. The definition of torture is infliction of severe physical pain as a means of punishment or coersion. Legal authorities around the world are arguing over what that means. Some insist the abuses at that Iraqi prison easily qualify along with sleep deprivation humiliation extreme fear. Others say those things do n't even come close. The global jury is still out. and even experts are pondering a paradox. So in your experience and in your view torture as a policy should be against the law. True. And yet we might still have to use it. True. And wondering which truth about torture will stand in a dangerous world. Tom Forman CNN Washington.\n","\n","Well it 's interesting President Bush has said categorically we do n't torture. He also says we 'll do whatever is necessary. So what exactly does that mean? We asked a couple law professors earlier this evening to discuss the issue with us. John Yoo of University of California Berkeley who served in the justice department from two thousand and one to two thousand and three. He 's also a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Also joining us Alan Dershowitz professor of law at Harvard the author of a great many books including The Case for Peace How the Arab Israeli Conflict can be Resolved. Also involved in discussion was Bill Goodman at the Center for Contitutional Rights. Here 's some of the conversation. Professor Dershowitz under what circumstances do you think torture is justified? Torture is never justified. and I hope we never have to use it in the United States. But if we ever had a ticking bomb terrorist who could under torture reveal the location of a bomb that would destroy hundreds of thousands of people I guarantee you we would use it. That 's an empirical judgement not a normative one. And if we would use it then we have to use it only with accountability. And that means that the president of the United States or the vice president or the secretary of defense or the chief justice has to specifically authorize precisely the kind of extreme measures that are permitted to be used. No extreme measures without accountability that has to be the rule. Bill Goodman you believe that 's uh a slippery slope. I think it 's a very slippery slope. I think once you start to say well under these circumstances empirically you 're going to and you have to provide these kinds of measures if you do it then you 're basically that under certain circumstances it can happen It should happen and then it 's going happen under more than those exceptional circumstances. It 's going to start becoming the regular rather than the unusual. Professor Yoo let me bring you in here um. What do you think about Professor Dershowitz 's argument that torture under any circumstances is wrong uh and that he supports the McCain amendment uh but at the president 's direction uh under extraordinary circumstances. I agree with much of what Alan says. I do think torture is wrong. it 's illegal. What the McCain amendment is just repeating is the Geneva convention standard that already applies in Iraq. what the problem with the McCain amendment is , that it prevents the CIA to use interrogation methods would not be torture but would fall under this vaguer term cruel inhumane degrading treatment which is. But what is your definition of torture? I mean uh I understand you were one of the lawyers in the justice department early on who helped craft documents outlining you know what some called a before nine eleven approach and after nine eleven approach. And the definition of torture uh that I understand from what I 've read that you were advocating was a very narrow one. look. we can all have an argument where exactly that line is. and I think it means severe pain and suffering either physical or mental can not be imposed. That would be torture. See. I would have a broader definition of torture. I would define it very broadly then prohibit it. But then if it 's felt necessary to use any of these measures short of torture water boarding extreme psychological measures if the president of the United States is prepared to put his credibility on the line and say the future of the nation is stake we must violate the law in this instance like we would if we had to shoot down a civilian airliner let the president take accountability. And that would broaden the definition of torture. It would n't have any of these escape valves that we now have and would place accountability squarely where it belongs not on the shoulders of sergeant England or some other low ranking official. right now you 're just being an apologist for torture. Oh come on. stop throwing around words like that. uh let me please finish. I mean that 's just insulting to the intelligence of the audience. Look. let me finish. You know that? Let me talk. and then you can answer. Yeah. Okay? you know better than that. what 's your point? my point is this that torture is new in the American discourse in many ways. We have not seen the prevalence , we have not seen an outcropping of torture notwithstanding all of the wars in which we 've engaged until this current administration. Totally false. totally false. it was rampant in the second world war. rampant. And please. I mean but is n't it true that there has always been torture? Always. There always has but not in the degree not in the level not in the amount that we have seen. Much worse. much worse. And the fact is that by saying that we are going to allow certain circumstances under which we will apologize for torture - Much worse in the Vietnam war. much worse in the Korean war. much worse. I ca n't talk without me. All right you 're saying it 's been much worse. Much worse. Professor Yoo eh President Bush says the US does not torture. Do you believe that 's true? Yeah I believe it 's not true , that if there is abuses like Abu Ghraib occuring they 're just illegal and ought to be punished. Professor Dershowitz does the US torture? Of course it does. and it does with a wink and a nod from the president of the United States from the secretary of defense from the vice president. Just the message he gave yesterday we do n't approve torture but we approve doing whatever is necessary to stop terrorism. And that sends a mixed message. Bill let me uh tell you something that Senator Roberts has said about the McCain amendment. He says and I 'm paraphrasing that basically the element of surprise what the enemy does not know about what we 're going to do to them is a very powerful tool. And so you do n't want to specify. you do n't want to write out exactly what can and can not be done. That is truly apologism for torture. That 's saying that torture does work can work. and it 's never been proven to work. Bill Goodman Professor Yoo Professor Dershowitz thanks very much. Thank you .\n","\n","Still ahead on Three Sixty . It may be off - year elections but they 're being closely watched . The latest results and what they say about the future .

All the things we did that we thought would make us more fascinating like high - powered careers . And we wanted that snappy Hepburn Tracy dialogue because actually a lot of guys find that draining . We 'll talk to her about that and a whole lot more .Be right back . Election returns are coming in from around the country. There are uh state and local races with nationally known faces and issues as well as a celebrity or two . With us tonight CNN 's John King and Jeff Greenfield. Let 's start with breaking news and John King in DC. What 's the latest John ?Anderson more statements from the democrats celebrating tonight more events planned by the democrats tomorrow. They believe they have the upper hand in these off - year elections. The two biggest races the races for the governorships of Virginia and New Jersey. Democrats winning in both of those states we can show you here. CNN projecting that Tim Kaine now the lieutenant governor will be the next governor of Virginia winning quite handily fifty - two to forty - six percent over republican Jerry Kilgore. Also in the state of New Jersey John Corzine the democrat with fifty - four percent of the vote right now beating Doug Forrester the republican just forty - three percent. Ninety - one percent of the vote counted in New Jersey. Ninety - nine percent of the vote counted now in Virginia. Two democratic victories in the races for governor. Republican Michael Bloomberg will win re-election in New York. Republicans will celebrate that. That a source of frustration to democrats . How much does this mean nationally ? That race in New Jeresey was much more personally nasty about property taxes perhaps than about President Bush or any national issues. The Virginia race about the death penalty about other state issues as well traffic number one among them. But the democrats will certainly that the Virginia race is proof that the republican base is demoralized. That will be studied Anderson as we look at these off - year elections and how much they play into next year. 'Many state ballot questions that are of some national import tonight. A anti-gas tax initiative in Washington state. we wo n't get the results there until tomorrow. A split verdict if you will on the issue of gay rights. Texas voters adopting a Constituional amendment to finding marriage as between a man and woman. but supporters of gay rights winning a referendum in the state of Maine. That is something to watch heading into next year as well because republicans think that helps increase turnout among conservatives. And ballots of course.

We respectfully invite you to watch a special edition of Across { China  }  [ 1 ] . WW II Landmarks on the Great Earth of { China  }  [ 1 ] : { Eternal Memories of Taihang Mountain' Standing tall on Taihang Mountain  }  [ 2 ] is the Monument to { the Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 3 ] . { It  }  [ 2 ] is composed of a primary stele , secondary steles , a huge round sculpture and beacon tower , and the Great Wall , among other things . A primary stele , three secondary steles , and two inscribed steles . { The Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 3 ] was { the campaign of the largest scale launched by the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance against Japan  }  [ 4 ] { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 5 ] during the War of Resistance against Japan . { This campaign  }  [ 4 ] broke through { the Japanese army  }  [ 6 ] 's blockade to reach base areas behind enemy lines , stirring up anti-Japanese spirit throughout { the nation  }  [ 1 ] and influencing the situation of the anti-fascist war of the people worldwide . This is Zhuanbi Village , Wuxiang County of Shanxi Province , where { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 5 ] was headquartered back then . On a wall outside the headquarters we found { a map  }  [ 7 ] . { This map  }  [ 7 ] was { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 5 ] { the Eighth Route Army 's  }  [ 5 ] depiction of the Mediterranean Sea situation at that time . { This map  }  [ 7 ] reflected the European battlefield situation .In 1940 , the German army invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia , Poland , the Netherlands , Belgium , and France . It was during this year that { the Japanese army  }  [ 6 ] developed a strategy to rapidly force the Chinese people into submission by the end of 1940 . In May , { the Japanese army  }  [ 6 ] launched -- From one side , { it  }  [ 6 ] seized an important city in China called Yichang . Um , , uh , through Yichang , { it  }  [ 6 ] could directly reach { Chongqing  }  [ 8 ] . Ah , that threatened { Chongqing  }  [ 8 ] . Then { they  }  [ 6 ] would , ah , bomb these large rear areas such as { Chongqing  }  [ 8 ] \",\n"," \"By 1940 , China 's War of Resistance against Japan had entered a stalemate . The situation on our side and the enemy 's side was intertwined . { The Eighth Route Army  }  [ 1 ] guerrillas were extraordinarily active , creating more and more trouble for the Japanese army in { North China  }  [ 2 ] . Hayao Tada , commander of the Japanese North China Area Army , adopted a strategy of siege warfare to deal with { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 1 ] . The specific method was building a closely connected transport network , with a road for every village and defensive towers on every road . Roads and railways were used as links to connect { all of North China  }  [ 2 ] { North China  }  [ 2 ] into a solid , widespread siege , in order to strangle { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 1 ] and { its  }  [ 1 ] base areas in this net . As part of { the Japanese army  }  [ 3 ] 's strategy of siege warfare , railways and roads had actually become { the Japanese army  }  [ 3 ] 's weapons of war , becoming a great threat to the base areas . In December 1939 , Commander - in - chief Zhu De and Vice Commander Peng Dehuai of { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 1 ] received { a top - secret telegram from Commander Lu Zhengcao of the Jizhong Military District , among other people  }  [ 4 ] . { The telegram  }  [ 4 ] said that the Japanese troops were building blockade trenches and chessboard - like roads to divide the Jizhong base area into small isolated blocks without the ability to mutually communicate and support each other , causing { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 1 ] and the guerrillas to lose maneuverability . Before { the Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 5 ] in 1940 , an inclination to compromise , ah , surrender , was an extremely serious crisis in the frontline situation in China . Well , on the battlefield behind enemy lines , in order to take over , consolidate { the area  }  [ 6 ] under { its  }  [ 6 ] occupation , { Japan  }  [ 7 ] began a new strategy . That was to use railways as a pillar , roads as a chain , and strongholds as a lock , to carry out siege warfare in an attempt to divide the base areas behind enemy lines , ah , so as , er , to cut off their communication with one another . In addition , { it  }  [ 7 ] relied on this cage , ah , to further strengthen { its  }  [ 7 ] assaults against the base areas . Er . So , it was amidst such a grave international and domestic situation that { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 1 ] led by the Chinese Communist Party , ah , launched , ah , a strategic offensive called { the Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 5 ] . This plot of { the Japanese army  }  [ 1 ] drew great attention from { Zhu De  }  [ 8 ] and Peng Dehuai of Eighth Route Army headquarters . After meticulous studies and painstaking preparations by many parties , a battle plan based on surprise was formulated . On July 22 , 1940 , a campaign preparation order to attack { the Zhengtai Railway  }  [ 9 ] , jointly signed by { Zhu De  }  [ 8 ] , Peng Dehuai , and Zuo Quan , was sent to Yan'an and all units of { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 1 ] . What was the , purpose and goal of { this campaign  }  [ 10 ] ? It was to break through { the Japanese army  }  [ 1 ] 's siege policy against base areas behind enemy lines , and to avert { the crisis of China 's compromise and surrender  }  [ 11 ] . It was to overcome { this crisis  }  [ 11 ] . Well , { the Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 5 ] was divided into three phases . Beginning from August 20 , from August 20 to September 10 , the main purpose of { the campaign  }  [ 10 ] was to sabotage { the Zhengtai Railway  }  [ 9 ] \",\n"," \"{ The Zhengtai Railway  }  [ 1 ] started from Zhengding , Hebei in the east and ended in { Taiyuan  }  [ 2 ] in the west , with a total length of 243 kilometers traversing the Taihang Mountain range . During the War of Resistance against Japan , { the Zhengtai Railway  }  [ 1 ] was a key strategic transportation line for the Japanese army in { North China  }  [ 3 ] . { It  }  [ 1 ] was also one of the major blockade lines for causing destruction to anti-Japanese base areas . Along { this railway line  }  [ 1 ] was the Niangziguan Pass , a natural barrier , and the Jingjing coalmine , a key fuel base in Yangquan for the Japanese military in { North China  }  [ 3 ] . Outside of { Taiyuan  }  [ 2 ] and Shijiazhuang , the Japanese military deployed the 4th , 8th , and 93rd mixed brigades and regiments , which were scattered among 50 strongholds along { the railway line  }  [ 1 ] . The situation was getting worse and worse for the Eighth Route Army and the anti-Japanese areas behind enemy lines . Actions had to be taken to break through the blockade . On a night in late July 1940 , the atmosphere in { Zhuanbi Village  }  [ 4 ] in Shaanxi was unusual . Villager Xiao Jianghe has a vivid memory of this piece of history . On that dark night , everyone was sleeping when human voices and neighing horses were heard within { the village  }  [ 4 ] . People all got up . Did something happen ? { Some folks  }  [ 5 ] got up . Opening { the street gate  }  [ 6 ] , { they  }  [ 5 ] saw a soldier standing by { the gate  }  [ 6 ] . Folks , go back , go back , nothing is wrong . Our troops are just going to stay here for the night . Do n't say you are scared . { Our  }  [ 7 ] commander is coming . I am telling you to go back to sleep peacefully . Ah , so { we  }  [ 7 ] went back to sleep . Ah , why should you come out if you were told not to ? By the time { we  }  [ 7 ] got up early the following morning , the sports ground in { Zhuanbi Village  }  [ 4 ] was packed with soldiers who had stationed there . Essentially the entire enemy had been destroyed . It was an arduous battle . At 10:00 p.m. on August 20 , 1940 , various units of the Eighth Route Army launched a full - scale offensive according to the general plan . The head of the County People 's Armed Forces Commission was named { Zhao Yemin  }  [ 8 ] . { Zhao Yemin  }  [ 8 ] came , ah , bringing a group of armed personnel and some things . Upon arriving , { he  }  [ 8 ] relayed an order , saying the road from Yangquan to Hedi must be cut off tonight , with the electrical wires slashed . He himself would bring , this group of people to blow up that Wudu bridge . Led by Nie Rongzhen , the Shanxi - Chahar - Hebei Military District was ready for an offensive , while at the same time , fifteen regiments laid an ambush in advance along { the Zhengtai Railway  }  [ 9 ] , launching fierce attacks on Japanese military strongholds along the railway line . It was also during { the night of August 20  }  [ 10 ] { August 20  }  [ 11 ] that the 129th Division directed by Division Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping , with eight regiments , including two regiments of the 1st Dare - to - Die Corps and eight independent battalions , formed left - flank and right - flank commandos and a central contingent . On { the night of August 20  }  [ 10 ] { August 20  }  [ 11 ] , offensives were launched against most of the Japanese independent 4th mixed brigade and part of the independent 9th mixed brigade along the western section of { the Zhengtai Railway  }  [ 9 ] . Additionally , two regiments , together with local armed forces in places such as Pingding , Liaoxian , and Yushe , carried out sabotage on the Pingliao and Yuliao roads and pinned down { the enemy  }  [ 12 ] at various points , ensuring safety of the main forces on the sides and rear . Current estimates are that this section was taken care of in less than four hours , three hours . After this was taken care of , { four blockhouses  }  [ 13 ] were blown up . By digging tunnels , { they  }  [ 13 ] charged out the center . Only then did { they  }  [ 13 ] , wipe out { the enemy  }  [ 12 ] . More than two hundred enemy soldiers were eliminated in a single blow . It was still during { this night  }  [ 10 ] that the 120th Division , directed by Division Commander He Long and Political Commissar Guan Xiangying , with 20 regiments , sabotaged the northern section of { the Tongpu Railway  }  [ 14 ] and some main roads west of { the railway  }  [ 14 ] . It also took over strongholds at Yangfangkou , Kangjiahui , and Fengrui Village , cutting off the northern section of { the Tongpu railway  }  [ 14 ] and the roads from Xinxian to Jingle and Fenyang . In order to coordinate with breakthrough battles at { the Zhengtai Railway  }  [ 14 ] and the northern section of { the Tongpu Railway  }  [ 14 ] , { the 129th Division and the Shanxi - Chahar - Hebei Military District  }  [ 15 ] also ordered { their  }  [ 15 ] \",\n"," \"On { the afternoon of August 22  }  [ 1 ] , { Peng Dehuai  }  [ 2 ] was listening to the combat operation director report on battle developments at { Eighth Route Army  }  [ 3 ] operational headquarters . When asked about the actual combat strength of { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 3 ] , the combat operation director reported : There are 30 regiments along the Zhengtai Line , 15 regiments along the Lugou Bridge - Handan section of the Pinghan line , 12 regiments along the Datong - Hongdong section in Tonghu County , and four regiments along the Tianjin - Dezhou section of the Jinpu Line , with a total of 105 regiments entering { the campaign  }  [ 4 ] . With a wave of his hand , { Peng Dehuai  }  [ 2 ] said that despite being over 100 regiments , let 's call { this campaign  }  [ 4 ] { the Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 5 ] . { That afternoon  }  [ 1 ] , { Peng Dehuai  }  [ 2 ] first used the name Hundred Regiments Offensive in telegrams sent to various military corps and the Central Military Commission . A total of 105 regiments participated in { the Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 5 ] . Well , it was a force of more than 200,000 soldiers . In addition to that , er , no less than 400,000 militiamen , guerrillas , and civilians , er , voluntarily participated in { the offensive  }  [ 5 ] . So , there were probably 600,000 - plus soldiers and civilians . { The Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 5 ] dealt a devastating blow to the enemy at Shi'nao Mountain . Our troops were strong , troops were strong . Er , and those in charge of logistics and support were able to follow in time . Er , , er , { the anti-Japanese vanguard team  }  [ 6 ] was composed of all young people in { their  }  [ 6 ] 20s ; all young people , all in { their  }  [ 6 ] \",\n"," \"This is Shi'nao Mountain , situated in { Yangquan , Shanxi  }  [ 1 ] , a strategic passage of { the Zhengtai Railway  }  [ 2 ] back then . On August 21 , 1940 , in order to pin down Japanese troops stationed in { Yangquan  }  [ 1 ] and to cover for militiamen sabotaging the western section of { the Zhengtai Railway  }  [ 2 ] , { the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 3 ] { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 4 ] ordered the main regiment of { its  }  [ 3 ] 385th Brigade , the 14th Regiment led by Brigade Commander Chen Xilian , to head directly for { Shi'nao Mountain  }  [ 5 ] to seize the high ground . Like a sharp sword , civilians in the western section broke through the strategic passage . Frustrated and angry , the Japanese army immediately deployed a large number of troops in an attempt to retake Shi'nao Mountain  . To the enemy 's complete surprise , desolate { Shi'nao Mountain  }  [ 5 ] had been turned into a strong combat fortress by our troops in less than a night . Like a lion with { its  }  [ 5 ] mouth wide open , towering and rugged { Shi'nao Mountain  }  [ 5 ] was constantly waiting for any invaders who dared come close . The night before , { we  }  [ 6 ] destroyed { the roads  }  [ 7 ] and cut off all electrical and railway lines , making { it  }  [ 8 ] impossible for { it  }  [ 8 ] to communicate . { It  }  [ 8 ] did not know how many of { us  }  [ 6 ] went to destroy { the roads  }  [ 7 ] , whether it was { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 4 ] or not , the regulars , or others  .It did not know , right ? After all , { its  }  [ 8 ] telephones had stopped working . Yeah , { the roads  }  [ 7 ] had been cut off , with { its  }  [ 8 ] vehicles unable to drive back and forth . The following seven days and nights were extremely tough . Starting from the 23rd , the Japanese army in Yangquan , backed by helicopters , launched nonstop fierce attacks on Shi'nao Mountain using chemical weapons . During the Shi'nao Mountain battle , our soldiers died in large numbers . So many died that the clean - up was done in batches . In addition , { many people  }  [ 9 ] were poisoned when toxic gas was released . { They  }  [ 9 ] were poisoned and did not know how to protect { themselves  }  [ 9 ] against { the poison  }  [ 10 ] . { They  }  [ 9 ] simply crawled on the ground and wetted handkerchiefs in the rain to cover { their  }  [ 9 ] noses against { the poison  }  [ 10 ] . Eh , medics were quite busy . Several days of autumn rain turned { the combat trenches  }  [ 11 ] extremely muddy . { The Eighth Route Army  }  [ 4 ] { The Eighth Route Army officers and soldiers soaking in the muddy water  }  [ 12 ] fought { their  }  [ 12 ] { their powerful enemy  }  [ 13 ] with utmost effort . With bombs exploding next to { the trenches  }  [ 11 ] , { they  }  [ 12 ] showed no fear at all . When { their  }  [ 12 ] blood turned the yellow soil red , { they  }  [ 12 ] applied iodine solution to { their  }  [ 12 ] { their wounds  }  [ 14 ] and closed { them  }  [ 14 ] with bandages . { They  }  [ 12 ] wrapped { them  }  [ 14 ] with bandages , and that was it .vUnder the powerful offensive of { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 4 ] , { the enemy  }  [ 13 ] was only able to defend { itself  }  [ 13 ] , without any strength to fight back . The battle proceeded very smoothly , with the initiative steadily in the grasp of { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 4 ] \",\n"," \"Since the strategic objective of the Hundred Regiments Offensive was to smash the enemy 's blockade of bases , it was of critical importance to destroy { the roads  }  [ 1 ] and remove strongholds . { The various units of the Eighth Route Army taking part in the battle  }  [ 2 ] wasted no time destroying { the roads  }  [ 1 ] . { They  }  [ 2 ] proposed not to leave behind a single rail , a single cross tie , a single railway station , a single blockhouse , a single bridge , or a single electricity pole . { They  }  [ 2 ] mobilized and organized the masses and won over the railway staff , making great effort to destroy the railroad , the stations , and related facilities by means including dismantlement , explosion , fire , and water . I was in charge of this , er , and -- Er , er , due to this -- To cut off the electricity , er , considered a deputy commander - in - chief responsible for these electricity lines .  I was responsible for this project , ah . The militiamen were divided into two groups . One was responsible only for cutting electrical wires , and the other for destroying roads . { We people  }  [ 3 ] , ah , were under his command for the time being . { We all  }  [ 3 ] took part in destroying roads . From { the Zhengtai road  }  [ 4 ] , from , um , Zhengding to , um , Shijiazhuang , to Taiyuan , more than 400,000 civilians participated in destroying roads . Most important at that time along { the Zhengtai road  }  [ 4 ] was mainly to destroy the Jinxi coal mine . Soldiers used hay cutters to sever the wire net , charging into the station and destroying the machine room and water tower , and then started to destroy { the road  }  [ 4 ] . Of the three to four thousand civilians participating in the battle , one soldier was added to every squad of 16 people formed . While destroying roads , there was clear - cut division of labor . Some took off screws ; some uprooted rail spikes ; some knocked off joint bars ; some removed cross ties ; some carried away rails . For cutting electrical wires , the militiamen in the village were waiting for the troops to come ,Ah , Over there , { a builder of the surrounding walls  }  [ 5 ] sabotaged transportation by pushing over { his  }  [ 5 ] surrounding walls . { It  }  [ 6 ] was built during the day , and at night , overnight militiamen shoveled { it  }  [ 6 ] over . The task of the 72nd Regiment was , er , { this destruction battle  }  [ 7 ] . { This destruction battle  }  [ 7 ] went on for a day and a night . Each day the general situation was different . -LSB- -LSB- { They  }  [ 8 ] attacked small bridges and small districts , and generally looted these stations . -RSB- -RSB- { They  }  [ 8 ] carried away the iron , the iron rails of the railway , er to make steel . Er , for { wood materials  }  [ 9 ] , local folks simply destroyed { them  }  [ 9 ] by fire . In this way , { they  }  [ 9 ] fought { the battle  }  [ 7 ] while at the same time destroying roads , stripping the entire 60 - li - long railway from Xingtai to Neiqiu within just a few days . In this way , a blockade line of steel regarded as a lifeline by the Japanese army was paralyzed . It was a very tough battle . { The enemy  }  [ 10 ] attacked several times , and each time { they  }  [ 10 ] were repelled . There were extremely heavy casualties . { Overseas Japanese in Yangquan City  }  [ 11 ] were all mobilized to participate in { the battle  }  [ 7 ] , including children of 15 to 16 years of age . { They  }  [ 11 ] wanted to have , { overseas compatriots  }  [ 12 ] get together so that { they  }  [ 12 ] \",\n"," 'The Hundred Regiments Offensive lasted three and a half months and involved two major offensive phrases and one anti-sweep phase . During the first phase from August 20 to September 10 , 1940 , a general offensive was launched on major transportation lines such as the Zhengtai , Tongpu , Pinghai , and Jinfu lines with an emphasis on destroying the Zhengtai Railway . During the second phase from September 22 to early October , the mission was to continue expanding battle achievements , to destroy the flanks of transportation lines , and to penetrate puppet strongholds in anti-Japanese bases .During the third phrase from October 6 to December 4 , the main task was to counterattack a retaliatory sweep by { the Japanese army and puppet army  }  [ 1 ] .

Just as Mao Zedong once praised : Who dares wield { his  }  [ 15 ] sword and make { his  }  [ 15 ] horse rear ? Only our great General Peng . { Correspondent Xu Xiaobing  }  [ 11 ] , covering frontline news at the time , snapped the shutter while artillery fire roared overhead .

Bullets and artillery fire whistled past { his  }  [ 12 ] head . During the three and a half months from August 20 to December 5 , 1940 , { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 16 ] fought a total of 1,824 battles large and small . A total of 46,480 Japanese soldiers and puppet soldiers were killed , wounded , or captured , or defected . Four hundred seventy - four kilometers of railroad and 1,502 kilometers of highway were destroyed . In addition , large quantities of other military supplies were seized or destroyed . After { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 16 ] launched { the Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 14 ] , newspapers from areas behind enemy lines in { North China  }  [ 17 ] to the large rear area continuously carried news of victories . Telegrams and letters of congratulation arrived in Yan'an from all directions . { Mao Zedong  }  [ 18 ] was deeply moved . This leader with a strong poetic temperament expressed { his  }  [ 18 ] joy in this kind of telegram . { The Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 14 ] caused great excitement .

In a congratulatory telegram to Zhu De and Peng Dehuai , Chiang Kai - Shek praised { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 16 ] { the Eighth Route Army 's  }  [ 16 ] resolute attacks for dealing a heavy blow to the enemy . By pinning down large numbers of Japanese soldiers on battlefields behind enemy lines in { North China  }  [ 17 ] , { the Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 14 ] delayed the Japanese army 's aggression southward . In addition , { the Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 14 ] was a response to the European battlefield , while enhancing the international reputation of the CPC and { the Eighth Route Army  }  [ 16 ] . { The Hundred Regiments Offensive  }  [ 14 ] wrote a glorious page in the history of { China  }  [ 19 ] 's War of { Resistance against Japan  }  [ 20 ] { Japan  }  [ 21 ] .

The reason is that in { its  }  [ 5 ] persistent alignment with the US , { Japan  }  [ 5 ] has ignored { its  }  [ 5 ] relations with other countries , especially { its  }  [ 5 ] Asian neighboring countries . What is clearly remembered by { its  }  [ 5 ] Asian neighboring countries is that on October 17 this year , in spite of opposition , { Junichiro Koizumi  }  [ 3 ] stubbornly , ah , visited Yasukuni Shrine for the fifth time during the four years since { he  }  [ 3 ] took office .

Uh-huh . Yeah . Well , speaking of the relationship issue , we have noticed that during US President Bush 's visit in { Japan  }  [ 2 ] , { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] made some declaration of this position . { He  }  [ 1 ] said , as long as { we  }  [ 3 ] get on good terms with { the US  }  [ 4 ] , then it follows naturally { we  }  [ 3 ] will have good relations with { our  }  [ 2 ] Asian neighboring countries . Well , regarding this attitude { he  }  [ 1 ] has adopted , well , two professors , how would you look at { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] 's diplomatic thinking ? Well , this is because { he  }  [ 1 ] is still using the pre-Cold - War diplomatic thinking after the Cold War , that is , { the United States  }  [ 4 ] is the number one superpower in { the world  }  [ 5 ] . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . { Japan  }  [ 2 ] is the second largest economy in { the world  }  [ 5 ] . Uh-huh .

As for { Japan  }  [ 3 ] , to { the US  }  [ 2 ] , { it  }  [ 3 ] furthermore has lost some assets , diplomatic assets when making negotiations with { the US  }  [ 2 ] . Uh-huh . Uh-huh .

Well , today , actually { the head of Japan 's Defense Agency  }  [ 7 ] { Japan  }  [ 3 ] 's Defense Agency again mentioned to { the US  }  [ 2 ] that it seems to feel regretful , why ? Uh-huh . That is , a bit regretful . Because , according to the two - plus - two intermediate report just reached , the US military bases in { Japan  }  [ 3 ] should undergo adjustment . However , it was met with strong opposition from the general public in { Japan  }  [ 3 ] . So it may be hard to implement . Uh-huh .

But now , { Koizumi  }  [ 2 ] is like a stick , let 's say , a post . Right . It takes three points to support a plane . Yeah . So , it turned out that they had such stuff on the surface .

Right , { his  }  [ 2 ] idea was actually criticized and opposed by some politicians even in { Japan  }  [ 7 ] . { He  }  [ 2 ] was strongly criticized and increasingly isolated . Ah . The domestic economy was also affected . Many people also mentioned , by valuing the US alone , you are ignoring { Asia  }  [ 3 ] . Yes . Now many media all issued statements and editorials .

In fact , we can say { he  }  [ 1 ] does not understand the current status of { Sino - Japanese  }  [ 4 ] { Sino - Japanese relations  }  [ 5 ] . Uh-huh . Actually , due to { his  }  [ 1 ] visit to Yasukuni Shrine and the cooling down of the political relationship , { Sino - Japanese  }  [ 4 ] { Sino - Japanese relations  }  [ 5 ] have suffered severe blows . { He  }  [ 1 ] is only indulging in { his  }  [ 1 ] unilateral wishful thinking . It is only what { he  }  [ 1 ] thinks . Uh-huh . We can see some concrete figures . For instance , from January to August this year , the latest statistics show that { Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan 's exports to China  }  [ 6 ] { China  }  [ 3 ] grew only by 3.2 % according to { China  }  [ 3 ] 's statistics . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . It grew only by 5.8 % according to { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's statistics . Uh-huh . Well , in previous years , it was always more than 25 % . In other words , { Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan 's exports to China  }  [ 6 ] { China  }  [ 3 ] were declining sharply . More than 25 % . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , at the same time , with respect to { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's investment in { China  }  [ 3 ] , during the first half of last year , { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's investment projects in { China  }  [ 3 ] decreased by 8.2 % while the contractual amount decreased by 0.4 % . They both showed that due to the cooling down of the political relationship , well , the economic relations between { China  }  [ 3 ] { China and Japan  }  [ 7 ] { Japan  }  [ 2 ] have already been severely affected . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . In addition , there has also been the impact on the feelings of peoples of { the two countries  }  [ 7 ] . Yeah . Originally , { Koizumi  }  [ 8 ] 's key fallacy for { his  }  [ 8 ] { his visits to Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 9 ] { Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 10 ] was that { my visits  }  [ 9 ] would not affect in any way our relations with Asia . Uh-huh . It is not like that in reality . Uh-huh . Well , when { Koizumi  }  [ 8 ] visits { Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 10 ] , { he  }  [ 8 ] is betting on the national interests of { Japan  }  [ 2 ] . That is to say , { he  }  [ 8 ] is selling the international image and national interests of { Japan  }  [ 2 ] at cheap prices . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So this is being paid at a heavy price . Uh-huh . Many Japanese people also see that this does not conform to { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's own fundamental interests , ah , as a country with so many international , um , interests . Interests . with national interests . At the same time , it also actually denigrates { Japan  }  [ 2 ] \",\n"," \"Well , with regard to { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] 's diplomatic thinking , there is still , that is , one question . Ah , people may also frequently ask such a question that since it is the most important thing for { a country  }  [ 2 ] to keep good relationship with { its  }  [ 2 ] neighboring countries , why would { Japan  }  [ 3 ] want to seek far and wide for what lies close at hand ? Right . Out of what consideration is { he  }  [ 1 ] doing this ? Well , um , { this Prime Minister Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] , ah , first of all , personally , { he  }  [ 1 ] is an individual with a kind of belief , a very rightist political belief . Well , it also precisely reflects a current political trend of forces surrounding the { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] administration . Uh-huh . It also reflects that nowadays { Japan  }  [ 3 ] , in { its  }  [ 3 ] eagerness to become a political power , well , wants to take advantage of the sentiments of extreme nationalism to move toward and realize this goal . For instance , they have , a kind of wrong doing . That is to say , if { Japan  }  [ 3 ] wants to become a powerful country commanding true respect , { it  }  [ 3 ] must get rid of the name of a defeated country , the name of an aggressor country in World War II . Uh-huh . So , { they  }  [ 3 ] chose a very dangerous road . Uh-huh . That is to say , { it  }  [ 3 ] tries to become a decent country by negating { its  }  [ 3 ] history as an aggressor . This is exactly a road that leads nowhere . Uh-huh . Well , { this road he takes  }  [ 4 ] { he  }  [ 1 ] takes will surely isolate { Japan  }  [ 3 ] from the international community and will definitely not make { it  }  [ 3 ] a political power in the end . Uh-huh . Well , { he  }  [ 1 ] chose { the wrong road  }  [ 4 ] . Ah , in addition , from { his  }  [ 1 ] point of view , { he  }  [ 1 ] is counting on { his  }  [ 1 ] luck to a large extent . We can also say that some think tank people around { him  }  [ 1 ] may have given { him  }  [ 1 ] the wrong idea . Perhaps { he  }  [ 1 ] was misled , wow . Ah . For example , regarding { his  }  [ 1 ] visits to Yasukuni Shrine , , { he  }  [ 1 ] says , if I , keep doing it like this , China , South Korea , ah , , that is to say , you will , grow tired of protesting . Once you see a lot of { it  }  [ 5 ] , you will get used to { it  }  [ 5 ] . So , you will swallow the bitterness while I keep doing like this . Uh-huh . However , it turns out to be exactly the opposite . { He  }  [ 1 ] did not know { this issue  }  [ 6 ] could bring big trouble to { Japan  }  [ 3 ] . { He  }  [ 1 ] did not know the seriousness of { the issue  }  [ 6 ] \",\n"," \"Well , we can say that an overall review of the current diplomatic status of { Japan  }  [ 1 ] should show two clear roads . Ha , one is to follow { the US  }  [ 2 ] blindly , which is one of { its  }  [ 2 ] very important diplomatic lines . And { we  }  [ 3 ] can also see the other one , that is , to continue damaging the relations with { its  }  [ 1 ] close neighbors Well , speaking of this , { we  }  [ 3 ] can also figure out that { Koizumi  }  [ 4 ] has seriously damaged the feelings of { his  }  [ 4 ] Asian neighboring countries several times since { he  }  [ 4 ] took office as { Japan  }  [ 1 ] 's prime minister in 2001 . { We  }  [ 5 ] compiled a background video clip here , and let { 's  }  [ 5 ] learn about some relevant information together . In February 2005 , just one day after Chinese people 's traditional Spring Festival , { the Japanese government  }  [ 1 ] claimed the lighthouse set on { Diaoyu Island  }  [ 6 ] by { Japan  }  [ 1 ] 's extreme rightist group without permission as { its  }  [ 1 ] national property and put in under the administration of { Japan  }  [ 1 ] . On March 16 , 2005 , { Japan  }  [ 1 ] 's Shimane Prefecture assembly voted to pass a measure bill concerning { Takeshima Day  }  [ 7 ] and officially designated February 22 as { Takeshima Day  }  [ 7 ] . As a result , this small island just a bit over 90 kilometers from Utsuryo Island , { South Korea  }  [ 8 ] , again triggered a diplomatic conflict between the two countries . { South Korea  }  [ 8 ] thinks that { this island called Dokdo Island  }  [ 6 ] has always been a Korean territory . On April 1 , 2005 , the Japanese Ministry of Education approved a new edition of history textbooks compiled by the new history textbook compilation committee and published by Fusosha Publishing House and announced the result officially on April 5 . There are very few amendments in the new edition of Japanese history textbooks . The parts of the old version that twisted the history and denied { its  }  [ 1 ] crime of aggression remained unchanged . Instead the Japanese claims of sovereignty of { South Korea  }  [ 8 ] { South Korea 's  }  [ 8 ] \",\n"," \"{ Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] has been in office for , { four years  }  [ 2 ] . Well , during { these four years  }  [ 2 ] , we can say , er , nothing has been much improved , whether in internal affairs or diplomacy . Originally , { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] , ah , took office because { he  }  [ 1 ] won a very high support rating as a reformer . Eh , at that time , { he  }  [ 1 ] pledged to reform { Japan  }  [ 3 ] 's internal political and economic situations . However , based on the current status of internal affairs , { his  }  [ 1 ] reform , ah , did not result , er , in what was expected at that time . In the diplomatic field , there has been constant friction with neighboring countries . So , right now , another important question is how exactly people in { Japan  }  [ 3 ] view { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] 's diplomatic or internal policies , Professor Jin ? Well , this is , let 's say that { Japanese  }  [ 4 ] { Japanese people  }  [ 5 ] now have finally started to cool down in { their  }  [ 5 ] attitude toward , this kind of impulsive actions . Uh-huh . Well , we know that among major { Japanese  }  [ 4 ] newspapers , that is , the most dominant newspapers expressing popular opinions , ranging from Asahi Shimbun to Tokyo Shimbun , etc , well , recently , even Yomiuri Simbun , which originally expressed support for { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] 's right - wing tendencies , has started to change sides . Uh-huh . That is to say , their tones might be different , but the consensus of { Japanese  }  [ 4 ] public opinion is that relations with Asian countries must be improved . So , { this  }  [ 6 ] has already become the mainstream { Japanese  }  [ 4 ] public opinion . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , specifically , { it  }  [ 6 ] means prohibiting visits to { Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 7 ] . This has been opposed by the Liberal Democratic Party and all opposition parties . Well , we know that the most important pillar in { Japan  }  [ 8 ] that supports the Japanese society is the Japanese business community . Well , the heads of several groups in the business community , for instance , the Japan Business Federation and the Japan Committee for Economic Development , all had frequent direct meetings with { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] , strongly cautioning { him  }  [ 1 ] not to visit { Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 7 ] , Uh-huh . Uh-huh . because { our  }  [ 9 ] economy will suffer if { our Japan  }  [ 8 ] { our  }  [ 9 ] { Japan  }  [ 8 ] can not survive in the international community . Uh-huh . As a result , nowadays , { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] \",\n"," \"Well , to { Japanese people  }  [ 1 ] , what { they  }  [ 1 ] are more concerned with is , for example , how my economy is developing , how my life will be , whether the national interests will be damaged , whether my personal interests will be affected , and so on and so forth . Well , we have noticed that in response to such questions , some analysts recently noted that { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's diplomacy will pay a heavy price for what he has been doing . As a matter of fact , Professor Liu , you also mentioned earlier that { Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan 's economy , for instance , the Sino - Japanese trade , has already been affected to some extent  }  [ 3 ] . Well , have { they  }  [ 3 ] started to pay the price already ? Well , I think , actually , as far as { Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan itself  }  [ 2 ] is concerned , { it  }  [ 2 ] still made some mistakes by { itself  }  [ 2 ] . For instance , actually { Koizumi  }  [ 4 ] won an overwhelming victory in the general election held on September 11 this year . At the same time { his  }  [ 4 ] power to form the cabinet was further strengthened . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Er , he himself thought , er , that { he  }  [ 4 ] was probably , , er , 200 % correct in what { he  }  [ 4 ] has been doing . Uh-huh . However , in { his  }  [ 4 ] diplomatic efforts , in terms of relations with neighboring countries , well , , we can say that { he  }  [ 4 ] indeed failed miserably . Uh-huh . Well , this itself also failed to meet { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's own demand for economic development and the trend of strengthening economic and trade relations with foreign countries , in particular , { the eastern Asian region  }  [ 5 ] , well , so as to bring about economic cooperation in { this region  }  [ 5 ] . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , looking at { Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan 's economy  }  [ 6 ] , we should say { it  }  [ 6 ] is currently recovering { its  }  [ 6 ] growth . Well , externally , { it  }  [ 6 ] mainly relies on the US and Chinese markets . Uh-huh . However , if { the Chinese market  }  [ 7 ] suffers from economic cool - down as political coldness takes heat off economic development , { it  }  [ 7 ] should produce { a very negative effect on Japan 's economy  }  [ 8 ] { Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan 's economy  }  [ 6 ] . Uh-huh . { This effect  }  [ 8 ] may not show until probably next year . Uh-huh . Well , just now , that is to say , { it  }  [ 9 ] was the political coldness that totally damaged { its  }  [ 9 ] \",\n"," \"Well , { we  }  [ 1 ] know , what all of { us  }  [ 1 ] should be more concerned is his failure in international affairs . That is , { this year  }  [ 2 ] marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations . Uh-huh . { Japan  }  [ 3 ] placed { its  }  [ 3 ] hope of becoming a permanent member of { the Security Council  }  [ 4 ] { this year  }  [ 2 ] . Uh-huh . Well , generally speaking , if it could n't get accepted { this year  }  [ 2 ] , well , the chances in future are extremely slim . Uh-huh . Well , among many reasons that blocked { Japan  }  [ 3 ] from getting accepted { this year  }  [ 2 ] , the most important one was that { its  }  [ 3 ] neighboring countries did not cast favorable votes . That is , { it  }  [ 3 ] did not -- { It  }  [ 3 ] failed to gain the support of countries in { its  }  [ 3 ] own region . Right . To become a permanent member of { the Security Council  }  [ 4 ] , the most important thing is to first win the support of your own region . Right . Well , right now { it  }  [ 3 ] is { its  }  [ 3 ] neighboring countries that did not support { it  }  [ 3 ] . Uh-huh . Therefore , we should say that { it  }  [ 3 ] is , right , this Prime Minister Koizumi who has single - handedly ruined { Japan  }  [ 3 ] 's dream of becoming a permanent member of { the Security Council  }  [ 4 ] \",\n"," \"Some analysts also mentioned this point , that is to say , right now , { Japan  }  [ 1 ] 's neighboring countries are basically very much disappointed with what { Koizumi  }  [ 2 ] has been doing . Well , { many countries  }  [ 3 ] have all abandoned { their  }  [ 3 ] hopes to further mend { their  }  [ 3 ] relations with { Japan  }  [ 1 ] . In this respect , such a question follows , that is , how far could { Koizumi  }  [ 2 ] go following { his  }  [ 2 ] diplomatic policy ? Well , from what can be seen now , that is , actually , er , let 's say , from the cabinet { he  }  [ 2 ] formed after { his  }  [ 2 ] victory of the general election for the second time , we could indeed see that { he  }  [ 2 ] has gathered , um , the statesmen , or politicians who approve visits to { Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 4 ] , Uh-huh . all into { the cabinet  }  [ 5 ] , everyone of { them  }  [ 5 ] , eh . { He  }  [ 2 ] , right , appointed { them  }  [ 5 ] as defense minister or foreign minister . Uh-huh . In fact we can see that { he  }  [ 2 ] is sort of determined on { this issue  }  [ 6 ] to fight against neighboring countries to the end . Uh-huh . This way , { he  }  [ 2 ] actually sent out a message that { he  }  [ 2 ] has no sincerity in , during { his  }  [ 2 ] term , improving the relations with neighboring countries . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . This will indeed lead to the great disappointment of neighboring countries in { him  }  [ 2 ] , and furthermore to their caution about whether next , { the prime minister , the defense minister , including  }  [ 7 ] , er , the foreign minister would all go pay { their  }  [ 7 ] respects at { Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 4 ] . If { that is the case  }  [ 8 ] , { it  }  [ 8 ] may have produced a very extensive negative impact on { its  }  [ 8 ] relations with neighboring countries . Uh-huh . Well , actually , right now even the European and US media have noted { this issue  }  [ 6 ] . Right . We , including US President Bush , who came to Pusan following his visit to Japan this time and then will arrive again in China , are , in fact , also very concerned with this future development of Sino - Japanese relations . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . That is because I recently met an American scholar whose first question to me was whether there will be any conflict in { the East China Sea region  }  [ 9 ] . Uh-huh . Ah , I do n't think it would be that serious , but we can see that the international community has already shown tremendous concern about the chaos to international relations in { this region  }  [ 9 ] \",\n"," \"In fact it is not merely an issue of Sino - Japanese relations or Japanese - Korean relations . It has triggered that -- Yeah . the nerves of the international community . Yeah . That is , the US public and scholars have , started to show concerns over the issue of right and wrong in WW II , the moral issue , that is , { the US  }  [ 1 ] has started to pay attention to { this issue  }  [ 2 ] . { The US  }  [ 1 ] has kept quiet on { the issue of Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 2 ] { Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 3 ] because { it  }  [ 1 ] wants to get along with everyone . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , { it  }  [ 1 ] has been an onlooker to the fighting among eastern Asian countries . But now { the US  }  [ 1 ] can no longer sit quietly any more . I think that if things go on like this , the US interests in this region are also going to suffer . Uh-huh . Uh-huh .Well , now let 's look at { this Koizumi  }  [ 4 ] { Koizumi  }  [ 5 ] , that is , the post-Koizumi era . What are { his  }  [ 5 ] standards for selecting { his  }  [ 5 ] successor ? Is visiting { Yasukuni Shrine  }  [ 3 ] a criterion ? Uh-huh . Yeah . This is one of the important indexes that , we should watch for regarding which road exactly Japan will take . However , based on the selection and formation of { his  }  [ 5 ] , er , cabinet , it seems that { Koizumi  }  [ 4 ] is making { his  }  [ 4 ] post-resignation arrangements , ah . { He  }  [ 4 ] has started to get ready . The { Koizumi  }  [ 4 ] era , well -- Has already prepared -- Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , following that , for instance , if { his  }  [ 4 ] { his successor is indeed Shinzo Abe  }  [ 6 ] { Shinzo Abe  }  [ 7 ] , well , what will { it  }  [ 6 ] mean if { Shinzo Abe  }  [ 7 ] takes office ? Well , actually , I see , ah , { Koizumi  }  [ 4 ] has dual purposes in arranging this cabinet , ah . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . That is , in fact , I now feel that { he  }  [ 4 ] \",\n"," \"Well , in politics , { he  }  [ 1 ] will go against you , eh , mainly on the issues of Yasukuni Shrine and textbooks , but in economic and trade affairs , er , { he  }  [ 1 ] still wants to safeguard { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's economic rights . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Right . { He  }  [ 1 ] is using some , eh , people who are , for instance , er , relatively moderate and pragmatic toward { China  }  [ 3 ] . Right . Right , right , right . for instance , a politician quite friendly with { China  }  [ 3 ] , that is , Toshihiro Nikai , um , was appointed as minister of Economy , Trade and Industry . Uh-huh . { Toshihiro Nikai  }  [ 4 ] . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , we also see that after { Nikai  }  [ 4 ] took office , { his  }  [ 4 ] speech on the Eastern China Sea issue , we should say , is quite appropriate . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Ah , in { his  }  [ 4 ] opinion , { he  }  [ 4 ] wants to have friendly negotiations , ah , with { China  }  [ 3 ] if { he  }  [ 4 ] sees that { China  }  [ 3 ] , er , has taken any action . { He  }  [ 4 ] does not think { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's unilateral action in this disputed area is friendly negotiation . Uh-huh . If { it is impossible for talks to go on  }  [ 5 ] , { it  }  [ 5 ] can still be postponed till future , en , when there is a chance to resume talks . Er , I think that to prevent the bilateral relations from suffering friction over specific issues , { his  }  [ 4 ] attitude like this should be -- Uh-huh . But , can { his  }  [ 4 ] \",\n"," 'Well , now { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] is constantly sending out the message that { he  }  [ 1 ] will step down voluntarily in { September  }  [ 2 ] { next year  }  [ 3 ] . Well , of course we could not believe completely 100 percent of what { he  }  [ 1 ] said about this , because it is not certain whether they will make accommodations to let { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] stay in office . But , if { he  }  [ 1 ] steps down in { September  }  [ 2 ] { next year  }  [ 3 ] , we will see who on this cabinet will be the prime minister . Uh-huh . Well , mainly we will see whether { he  }  [ 1 ] gives priority to diplomacy or internal affairs and whether { he  }  [ 1 ] is more a hawk or a dove . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . We know there are several other people , such as Sadakazu Tanigaki and other economic figures , and those people mentioned by Professor Liu just now like Toshihiro Nikai . Uh-huh . { This Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] has made some preparations after all , that is , { he  }  [ 1 ] made dual preparations . Uh-huh . So , { we  }  [ 4 ] still have to urge { this Japanese government  }  [ 5 ] , ah , not to continue isolating { itself  }  [ 5 ] like { this  }  [ 6 ] . { We  }  [ 4 ] are certainly willing to watch for { this  }  [ 6 ] ',\n"," \"All right . For our final topic , let 's go back to the APEC meeting this time . Uh-huh . Well , as we mentioned earlier at the beginning , eh , a very important purpose for { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] to go to attend the APEC leaders ' summit in { Pusan  }  [ 2 ] this time is to see if { he  }  [ 1 ] could try to improve the relations with neighboring countries through talks with President Roh Moo - hyun , as if { he  }  [ 1 ] were clutching at a life - saving straw . But , could you analyze and predict what kind of achievements { he  }  [ 1 ] can make during { his  }  [ 1 ] trip to { Pusan  }  [ 2 ] ? Well , I think that actually the greatest achievement for { him  }  [ 1 ] is that { he  }  [ 1 ] should see facts . What kind of facts ? That is , the issue of right and wrong . Well , some people say that as { China  }  [ 3 ] { China 's economy  }  [ 4 ] is growing , { Japan  }  [ 5 ] is getting somewhat jealous . Er , as two powers are juxtaposed , the relations between the two countries have become somewhat tense . In reality it is not necessary so . For instance , { China  }  [ 3 ] { China 's economy  }  [ 4 ] is growing , eh , and getting stronger , but we see the relations between { China  }  [ 3 ] { China and South Korea  }  [ 6 ] { South Korea  }  [ 7 ] are indeed developing rapidly . Uh-huh . Well , the current trade between { China  }  [ 3 ] { China and South Korea  }  [ 6 ] { South Korea  }  [ 7 ] has reached nearly 100 billion US dollars . Uh-huh . Er , within another period of time , er , that is , by 2012 when it is , the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between { China  }  [ 3 ] { China and South Korea  }  [ 6 ] { South Korea  }  [ 7 ] , 200 billion US dollars ' worth of economic trade can be reached . Yeah . So , { this  }  [ 8 ] will have surpassed what { it  }  [ 8 ] is now for { Japan  }  [ 5 ] and { China  }  [ 3 ] which still failed to reach 200 billion US dollars at this 33rd anniversary of the normalization of { their  }  [ 6 ] diplomatic relations . Uh-huh . We can say , the economic development in { South Korea and China  }  [ 6 ] { South Korea  }  [ 7 ] and { China  }  [ 3 ] , to borrow Roh Moo - hyun 's words , is developing rapidly . Uh-huh . In addition , we can see that { South Korea  }  [ 7 ] has been improving { its  }  [ 7 ] relations with { all neighboring countries with the exception of Japan  }  [ 9 ] { the exception of Japan  }  [ 10 ] { Japan  }  [ 5 ] . Uh-huh . { China  }  [ 3 ] has also significantly improved { its  }  [ 3 ] relations with { all neighboring countries with the exception of Japan  }  [ 9 ] { the exception of Japan  }  [ 10 ] { Japan  }  [ 5 ] \",\n"," \"I think this can only prove { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] 's stubbornness . I do n't think it is certain at this point that { he  }  [ 1 ] will change suddenly and completely . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . That is to say , this time { he  }  [ 1 ] could only further expose { his  }  [ 1 ] poor diplomatic skills and { his  }  [ 1 ] isolation to the international community . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , based on { his  }  [ 1 ] past remarks and deeds , it is hard to determine whether { he  }  [ 1 ] will suddenly change { his  }  [ 1 ] diplomatic policy after { he  }  [ 1 ] returns . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , there is very little chance in this regard . Er , judging from the situation { he  }  [ 1 ] is in while participating in the APEC meeting , er , I am afraid { he  }  [ 1 ] may not be suffering from friction with neighboring countries only . Apart from that , er , some sources disclosed , for instance , { he  }  [ 1 ] has also had some problems on this issue with some Latin American countries . Yes . So , just as we mentioned at the start of the program , during { his  }  [ 1 ] trip to Pusan , { Koizumi  }  [ 1 ] must feel not only isolated but also surely frustrated . Uh-huh . All right . Thank you very much , ah , well , Professor Liu Jiangyong and Professor Jin Xide , for coming to { our  }  [ 2 ] studio to participate in { our  }  [ 2 ] program , ah , and introduce to { us  }  [ 2 ] so much relevant information .

These are all topics we will be focusing on today . { Two experts  }  [ 4 ] have been invited to { our  }  [ 5 ] { our studio  }  [ 6 ] . Let me briefly introduce , one is Mr. Jin Xide , an expert on { Japanese  }  [ 7 ] issues from { the Academy of Social Sciences  }  [ 8 ] { Social Sciences  }  [ 9 ] . Hello ! The other one is Mr. Xing Guangcheng , an expert on { Russian  }  [ 3 ] issues from { the Academy of Social Sciences  }  [ 8 ] { Social Sciences  }  [ 9 ] . Hello ! Welcome to { the two experts  }  [ 4 ] , for coming to { the studio  }  [ 6 ] for { our  }  [ 5 ] interview . Well , at the beginning of the program , let 's learn about the situation in { Japan  }  [ 2 ] . Let 's now connect via telephone with Mr. Wang Xinsheng , an expert on { Japanese  }  [ 7 ] issues from Beijing University who is currently visiting { Japan  }  [ 2 ] . Hello , Professor Wang . Ah , hello , host ! First , please brief { us  }  [ 5 ] on what was discussed during today 's talks between the { Russian  }  [ 3 ] and Japanese leaders . Was the four northern islands issue touched upon ? Eh , well , President Putin and Prime Minister Koizumi , ah , the two talked for a total of two and a half hours and signed a total of 12 documents . It should be said that quite a large number of documents were signed . However , the general reaction from scholars , media , or ordinary people here , er , is rather low key , because , er , there has been no progress on the two issues that { Japan  }  [ 2 ] \",\n"," \"Regarding { the Northern Territories issue  }  [ 1 ] , , er , { President Putin  }  [ 2 ] purposely avoided { this issue  }  [ 1 ] , that is , { he  }  [ 2 ] did not really want to talk about { it  }  [ 1 ] . Uh-huh . Well , in fact , it can be said that there has still been no progress on territorial issues . Uh-huh . So the two sides abandoned plans for a joint declaration . Well , on { the oil pipeline route issue  }  [ 1 ] , though { the Russian side  }  [ 3 ] promised to connect { it  }  [ 3 ] with { Japan  }  [ 4 ] , there was no talk about prioritizing a connection with { Japan  }  [ 4 ] . { The media here  }  [ 5 ] is concerned because { Russia  }  [ 3 ] already promised to prioritize connecting { it  }  [ 3 ] with China , er , , so { the media here  }  [ 5 ] is concerned that { it  }  [ 3 ] is an empty promise . In this way , { Japan  }  [ 4 ] may not get , er , any material benefit , while { the Russian side  }  [ 3 ] { Russian  }  [ 6 ] side will have gained { Japan  }  [ 4 ] 's support for { its  }  [ 3 ] WTO accession . Er , in addition , at the Business Federation meeting , { Russian President Putin  }  [ 2 ] { Russian  }  [ 6 ] President Putin urged the Japanese business community to invest in { Russia  }  [ 3 ] . However , due to the territorial issues , or little progress on the territorial issues , along with the business community 's concerns with the investment environment in { Russia  }  [ 3 ] , well , it remains a big question how far economic cooperation can go . Uh-huh . { Host  }  [ 7 ] . This was the main content of the two leaders ' talks today . Well , what kind of response did people in { Japan  }  [ 4 ] have to , well , some of the achievements this trip to { Japan  }  [ 4 ] has made ? Er , it is still rather , er , low key . that is to say , ah , er , we also saw , er , in Tokyo , { some right - wing groups  }  [ 8 ] held demonstrations , demanding that { Russia  }  [ 3 ] , return the four northern islands . Well , { they  }  [ 8 ] are also extremely dissatisfied because no progress has been made on this issue . Well , both { the media and citizens  }  [ 9 ] have such concerns , that is to say , { they  }  [ 9 ] are afraid that resolution of territorial issues may take rather . { Host  }  [ 7 ] . Okay , thank you very much , Professor Wang , for briefing us on the relevant information in { Japan  }  [ 4 ] \",\n"," \"Well , next we will return to { the studio  }  [ 1 ] to interview the two experts in { the studio  }  [ 1 ] . Just now , this Professor Wang talked about { Putin  }  [ 2 ] { Putin 's visit to Japan  }  [ 3 ] { Japan  }  [ 4 ] this time . Although the two sides signed 12 agreements , it seems that { Japan  }  [ 4 ] is not very satisfied with the content of the agreements , ah , in terms of the content , because it seems that neither of the two issues that { Japan  }  [ 4 ] wanted greatly to talk about , the four northern islands issue and the oil pipeline issue , made the achievements { they  }  [ 4 ] had anticipated . Well , was { this  }  [ 5 ] within the expectations of you two experts ? Right , { this  }  [ 5 ] is rather consistent with unanimous international public opinion analysis as well as our opinion these days . Uh-huh . Well , , this discussion , { it  }  [ 6 ] was a meeting of the leaders of both sides , which by { itself  }  [ 6 ] is an achievement . Uh-huh . As we know , { Putin  }  [ 2 ] has kept putting off { this visit  }  [ 3 ] to { Japan  }  [ 4 ] since last year , like back then when { Yeltsin  }  [ 7 ] repeatedly postponed { his  }  [ 7 ] trip to { Japan  }  [ 4 ] . That is to say , { Japan  }  [ 4 ] asked for too high a price . That is , { it  }  [ 4 ] asked { the Russian president  }  [ 2 ] { Russian  }  [ 8 ] president to come to { Japan  }  [ 4 ] to make concessions on territorial issues . Well , , well , { the Russian president  }  [ 2 ] { Russian  }  [ 8 ] president , was unwilling to make concessions . Therefore , the itinerary was not decided for a long time . Well , { Russia  }  [ 9 ] 's attitude was that { it  }  [ 9 ] would not talk about territorial issues if { it  }  [ 9 ] went . Well , , from the perspective of { Japan  }  [ 4 ] , without discussion of territorial issues , the talks were viewed as making no progress . For Japanese citizens , { this  }  [ 10 ] was meaningless . Uh-huh . { It  }  [ 10 ] only provided { Koizumi  }  [ 11 ] with a diplomatic stage . What method does { he  }  [ 11 ] want to use to remedy the lethargic post-APEC diplomatic situation ? Well , what { Russia  }  [ 9 ] actually wants is economic cooperation with { Japan  }  [ 4 ] , Uh-huh . including the development of oil resources in eastern Siberia , and , um , some other investment and trade . Well , { Japan  }  [ 4 ] \",\n"," \"Er , Director Xing , it can be said that this time one of the very important purposes of { President Putin  }  [ 1 ] { President Putin 's visit to Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan  }  [ 3 ] is to facilitate the progress of bilateral relations through economic development . But from what our Professor Wang has just introduced , do you think { Putin  }  [ 1 ] has achieved { his  }  [ 1 ] aim ? Eh , { he  }  [ 1 ] should be said to have achieved { his  }  [ 1 ] aim . Uh-huh . { The visit to Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan  }  [ 3 ] was in { itself  }  [ 2 ] one of { Putin  }  [ 1 ] 's important aims . Uh-huh . Because with large preconditions having been set , and now the framework having being set , it is impossible for { Putin  }  [ 1 ] , that is to say , to make major breakthroughs on the substantive issues of Russian - Japanese relations . Uh-huh . Well , as { two neighboring nations  }  [ 4 ] , ah , relations between { them  }  [ 4 ] should be developed , development of relations should be further promoted . There should be exchanges back and forth , which would not work if { Putin  }  [ 1 ] , refuses to come . So , well , , how did { he  }  [ 1 ] come to { Japan  }  [ 3 ] ? As mentioned earlier , ah , it had been postponed again and again , but by way of this kind of opportunity , well , { Putin  }  [ 1 ] { Putin 's visit to Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan  }  [ 3 ] was smoothly accomplished . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . As to what kind of result you want , that is another matter . Right . But making { the trip  }  [ 5 ] was significant in { itself  }  [ 5 ] . What was the significance ? It was that { Russia  }  [ 6 ] sent a very important message , that is , { Russia  }  [ 6 ] is willing to develop relations with { Japan  }  [ 3 ] . { We  }  [ 7 ] sincerely have such a wish . A wish is the start of achieving results . { We  }  [ 7 ] have such a start . Both leaders saved a bit of face . Right , right , right , in addition to giving face to each other . Also , on the surface { we  }  [ 7 ] saw it looked fine , with , 12 documents signed as just mentioned . They both gave face . Right . It is another matter if { you care about the size of the documents  }  [ 8 ] . But { they  }  [ 8 ] were signed . Uh-huh . Well , can we interpret it this way ? Based on the briefing given by you two experts , { both Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Russian President Putin  }  [ 9 ] , { they  }  [ 9 ] { they both  }  [ 10 ] achieved { their  }  [ 10 ] own aims in form and , er , obtained what { they  }  [ 10 ] wanted through this visit . On { this point  }  [ 11 ] , { their  }  [ 10 ] two fates are connected . Uh-huh .That is to say , both sides have strong nationalist sentiments domestically and powerful parliaments . Well , I think at { this point  }  [ 11 ] it would be ludicrous for Putin to concede on { the territorial issues  }  [ 12 ] . Uh-huh . Well , as you should know , it is entirely , impossible behavior . Right . Well , it seems it may also be very difficult for Koizumi now , that is to say , on { the territorial issues  }  [ 12 ] \",\n"," \"Well , recently , that is , , { new Foreign Minister Aso  }  [ 1 ] proposed a theory of joint development , that is , to postpone -LSB- -LSB- the issue of sovereignty of the northern -RSB- -RSB- and to jointly develop the , , four islands . Well , in fact { the theory of joint development  }  [ 2 ] was originally proposed by { Russia  }  [ 3 ] . Well , in the past , for instance , in 1996 , { Primakov  }  [ 4 ] also proposed { it  }  [ 2 ] when { he  }  [ 4 ] was foreign minister . { It  }  [ 2 ] had been raised prior to that too , but { Japan  }  [ 5 ] did not accept { it  }  [ 2 ] at that time . Well , why did { Taro Aso  }  [ 1 ] recently again propose , er , such a suggestion ? Well , I checked some data , ah . { Japan  }  [ 5 ] 's recent reaction is not { Japan  }  [ 5 ] 's mainstream domestic opinion . Uh-huh . Well , { domestic political circles in Japan all  }  [ 6 ] { Japan  }  [ 5 ] all opposed this suggestion by { Taro Aso  }  [ 1 ] . Uh-huh . { They  }  [ 6 ] said that with joint development , { Russia  }  [ 3 ] would advocate adopting the current { Russian  }  [ 7 ] controlled situation , the current situation , and applying { Russian  }  [ 7 ] law . Well , by making investments there , in fact , well , it would be equivalent to permanent recognition that { the four islands  }  [ 8 ] are { Russia  }  [ 3 ] 's . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So { this theory of joint development  }  [ 2 ] will not be able to make progress either . So under the current situation , the meeting of the two leaders itself was the greatest achievement this time . The rest did not have any substantive significance . Right . Uh-huh . I 'd like to add a few words . Regarding the joint development he talked about , { Russia  }  [ 3 ] is also very interesting . { the Japanese  }  [ 9 ] proposed { it  }  [ 3 ] , now { Russia  }  [ 3 ] instead rejected { it  }  [ 3 ] . { It  }  [ 3 ] rejected { it  }  [ 3 ] , { its  }  [ 3 ] { its government  }  [ 3 ] stated very clearly , we can not jointly develop { the four northern islands  }  [ 8 ] . This is a very interesting issue . Right . { They  }  [ 9 ] dropped { it  }  [ 3 ] . Right . What do you say about this ? Er , , , , { it  }  [ 3 ] , also has { its  }  [ 3 ] vigilance . Well , this also has a lot to do with { Russia  }  [ 3 ] 's strategy of building a powerful nation . { Russia  }  [ 3 ] now , { it  }  [ 3 ] has independently formulated a strategic vision of developing the Far East and Siberian regions . { It  }  [ 3 ] has { such a vision  }  [ 10 ] . Uh-huh . { The four northern islands  }  [ 8 ] are included in { this grand vision  }  [ 10 ] \",\n"," \"Today , among { our  }  [ 1 ] topics , the four northern islands can be said to be the core topic . { We  }  [ 1 ] can discuss this issue again in detail at the end . Well , before this , { we  }  [ 1 ] have one more question , that is , er , regarding { the issue of this Russian President Putin 's repeated postponement of his visit to Japan  }  [ 2 ] { this Russian President Putin  }  [ 4 ] { Russian  }  [ 3 ] President Putin 's repeated postponement of { his  }  [ 4 ] { his visit to Japan  }  [ 5 ] { Japan  }  [ 6 ] , well , many viewers may have some questions on { this issue  }  [ 2 ] . Well , we happen to have { a background video clip  }  [ 7 ] here . Let 's gain some understanding through { this background video clip  }  [ 7 ] . Why did { Russian  }  [ 3 ] { Russian President Putin  }  [ 4 ] visit { Japan  }  [ 6 ] again after , an interval of five years , after quite a few twists and turns ? It can be said that { Putin  }  [ 4 ] 's visit to { Japan  }  [ 6 ] after an interval of five years was realized following quite a few twists and turns . { The visit  }  [ 5 ] was first scheduled for the second half of 2004 . { The Japanese side  }  [ 8 ] hoped that after winning the presidential election in March of that year , { Putin  }  [ 4 ] could personally intervene in the territorial issues existing between { Japan  }  [ 6 ] { Japan and Russia  }  [ 9 ] { Russia  }  [ 10 ] for a long time . However , by May , { the Russian side  }  [ 8 ] said { it  }  [ 8 ] could not provide measures for resolving the territorial issues , and { Putin  }  [ 4 ] { Putin 's visit to Japan  }  [ 5 ] { Japan  }  [ 6 ] was pushed to the spring of 2005 . While { Japan  }  [ 6 ] expressed helplessness to this , { it  }  [ 6 ] hoped { Putin  }  [ 4 ] could visit in February as it was the 150th anniversary of the signing of a trade and border treaty between { Japan  }  [ 6 ] { Japan and Russia  }  [ 9 ] { Russia  }  [ 10 ] . However , { Putin  }  [ 4 ] responded only with a congratulatory telegram , with no mention of { his  }  [ 4 ] { his visit to Japan  }  [ 5 ] { Japan  }  [ 6 ] . On September 2 , 2004 , { Koizumi  }  [ 11 ] went by boat to tour the four northern islands . This move at once infuriated { Russia  }  [ 10 ] . Accordingly , the date of { Putin  }  [ 4 ] { Putin 's visit to Japan  }  [ 5 ] { Japan  }  [ 6 ] turned into a variable which nobody could explain . In various versions , some said { Putin  }  [ 4 ] would visit { Japan  }  [ 6 ] in April 2005 , some said May , while others said June . In { Russia  }  [ 10 ] 's diplomatic circles , there were even widespread rumors , including that { Putin  }  [ 4 ] would not visit { Japan  }  [ 6 ] within the year and that { Russia  }  [ 10 ] 's ambassador to { Japan  }  [ 6 ] would soon be removed . Various speculation existed until May 2005 , at { the celebration of the 60th anniversary of victory in the world 's anti-fascist war  }  [ 12 ] . Under pressure from various sides , { Koizumi  }  [ 11 ] reluctantly attended { this celebration  }  [ 12 ] . Furthermore , precisely because of this , { Putin  }  [ 4 ] { Putin 's visit to Japan  }  [ 5 ] { Japan  }  [ 6 ] was basically confirmed . This time , on { this visit  }  [ 5 ] , er , between { Russia  }  [ 10 ] and { Japan  }  [ 6 ] , ah , er , as far as { Japan  }  [ 6 ] was concerned , { it  }  [ 6 ] really hoped that { Russian President Putin  }  [ 4 ] would talk about the four northern islands issue during { his  }  [ 4 ] { his visit  }  [ 5 ] . However , { Russia  }  [ 10 ] \",\n"," \"Well , was this also the reason that caused { Russian President Putin  }  [ 1 ] , in spite of the two being close neighbors these five years , to visit { Japan  }  [ 2 ] again only after , an interval of five years ?  { this  }  [ 3 ] is not just during { Putin  }  [ 1 ] 's tenure , that is , { it  }  [ 3 ] has been like this for the 60 years after { the war  }  [ 4 ] . Uh-huh . That is , whether there should be a separation of politics and economics or not . That is , whether it should be economic cooperation first or resolution of political issues first . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , this eased for a period after { the Cold War  }  [ 4 ] during the { Gorbachev  }  [ 5 ] era . Uh-huh . That is , { Gorbachev  }  [ 5 ] recognized the four islands issue between { Japan  }  [ 2 ] and { Russia  }  [ 6 ] . There was nothing like this in the past . In the past , only the issue of { two islands  }  [ 7 ] was recognized . Well , there was once { an opportunity for this  }  [ 8 ] , but { Japan  }  [ 2 ] again did not seize { it  }  [ 8 ] . Uh-huh . { Russia  }  [ 6 ] has changed a lot as well . Well , later , that is , after several changes , for instance , during Hashimoto Ryutaro 's term , ah , { Russia  }  [ 6 ] proposed separating politics from economics , to make progress on both at the same time . Uh-huh . However , when it came to the critical moment , that is , on { the territorial issues  }  [ 9 ] , perhaps due to { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's domestic nationalist sentiments and the sensitivity of { the territorial issues  }  [ 9 ] , it was impossible for { any prime minister  }  [ 10 ] to claim for two islands only . Uh-huh . When talks on { the two islands  }  [ 7 ] came to a final decision , { the Japanese prime minister  }  [ 10 ] retreated again to the point that politics and economics could not be separated and that political issues should still be resolved first . Uh-huh . Well , in addition , the Russian president was exactly the opposite , that is , denying at critical moments that there were territorial issues , that is , sometimes even the issue of { the two islands  }  [ 7 ] . Uh-huh . That is , it was impossible to give the territories to { Japan  }  [ 2 ] \",\n"," \"I think in the near future , er , the possibility of breakthrough progress is also , very small . Eh , we all know { Japan  }  [ 1 ] is the second largest economy in the world . Furthermore , { Japan  }  [ 1 ] is also a very important investor overseas . However , a set of data shows that { Japanese  }  [ 2 ] investment in { Russia  }  [ 3 ] accounts for only 1 % of { its  }  [ 2 ] investments overseas , that is , just over 700 million US dollars . Well , as { Russia  }  [ 3 ] should be said to badly need { Japanese  }  [ 2 ] funds , as well as badly needing { Japanese  }  [ 2 ] economic cooperation , well , how urgent do you think { Russia  }  [ 3 ] 's need is ? I think the time of { Russia  }  [ 3 ] 's most urgent need is already over . Uh-huh . { The most urgent time  }  [ 4 ] was still the 1990s . At { that time  }  [ 4 ] , { Russia  }  [ 3 ] was indeed pressing for { Japanese  }  [ 2 ] investment . Uh-huh . Because { Russia  }  [ 3 ] was in a deep degree of overall crisis . Uh-huh . It was like { a very thirsty man who needs to drink water  }  [ 5 ] . At such time , { he  }  [ 5 ] , needs someone else to give { him  }  [ 5 ] a cup of water . Uh-huh . Well , now , the economic crisis in { Russia  }  [ 3 ] is essentially over . Well , under such circumstances , { Russia  }  [ 3 ] , er , { it  }  [ 3 ] can make diplomatic arrangements calmly . Uh-huh . Therefore , I think { Japan  }  [ 1 ] , that is , again lost the best opportunity to enter the Russian market . Uh-huh . { It  }  [ 6 ] can not be said to have lost { it  }  [ 6 ] forever . In other words , that time was the best , a relatively good period . Uh-huh . Why should we say that ? That is to say , at that time if { Japan  }  [ 1 ] had made a very good investment in { Russia  }  [ 3 ] , well , { Japan  }  [ 1 ] , in terms of { Russia  }  [ 3 ] 's economy , { it  }  [ 1 ] could have helped { Russia  }  [ 3 ] \",\n"," \"Uh-huh . Well , currently { Japan  }  [ 1 ] is very important to { Russia  }  [ 2 ] again . Well , as a neighboring nation , especially as { Japan  }  [ 1 ] is a world economic power , { Russia  }  [ 2 ] really needs { Japanese  }  [ 3 ] investment , now not { Japanese  }  [ 3 ] aid , but { its  }  [ 3 ] investment . Uh-huh . It can also be said it is this way strategically . { Putin  }  [ 4 ] { Putin 's current strategy  }  [ 5 ] is to build a powerful nation , a strategy for making { his country  }  [ 2 ] { his  }  [ 4 ] country powerful and { his  }  [ 4 ] people rich . Uh-huh . Well , { this strategy  }  [ 5 ] is extremely clear . { He  }  [ 4 ] used an expression , saying that { Russia  }  [ 2 ] 's diplomacy is economic diplomacy . All , diplomatic activities must promote { Russia  }  [ 2 ] 's prosperity , eh , development , and wealth and power . Uh-huh . Well , seen from this perspective , well , { Japan  }  [ 1 ] is very important to { Russia  }  [ 2 ] . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Therefore , just now you mentioned some figures regarding Russian - Japanese relations , that is , economic and trade relations , for such a large , such a powerful economy as { Japan  }  [ 1 ] , well , { it  }  [ 1 ] invested only 700-plus million in { Russia  }  [ 2 ] . This is extremely small . Uh-huh . Said it will be ten billion . Well , { last year  }  [ 6 ] 's trade volume was perhaps more than 9 billion . { This year  }  [ 6 ] , , Koizumi said it may exceed 100 trillion . { This  }  [ 7 ] is a very small figure in terms of trade relations between { two countries  }  [ 8 ] . { It  }  [ 7 ] has nearly reached 200 billion between { China and Japan  }  [ 8 ] { Japan  }  [ 1 ] . So . Right . Here { it  }  [ 7 ] has a comparison . er , between { Russia  }  [ 2 ] { Russia and Japan  }  [ 8 ] { Japan  }  [ 1 ] , the trade volume only equals , of Sino - Japanese trade volume , one twenty - second . Uh-huh . Right . It seems to be one twenty - second , or one nineteenth . Well , what does { this status  }  [ 9 ] show ? Right , just about , eh . I will explain two issues -- one , { it  }  [ 9 ] may show that the economic environment in { Russia  }  [ 2 ] is indeed not very good . Uh-huh . In general , none of the , eh , large nations in the world , have entered { the Russian market  }  [ 10 ] with much ease . Uh-huh . This is an objective factor , but there is a subjective factor too . That is to say , it is not that { Japan  }  [ 1 ] does not need { the Russian market  }  [ 10 ] . Perhaps some non-economic factor is playing a role . It has always been the territorial issue . Well , as we said , this kind of nationalist sentiment plays a great role here . So one very important aim of { Putin  }  [ 11 ] 's visit this time , which I also think is very clever , is to put aside some very sensitive old territorial topics . This topic is hard to tackle . Uh-huh . However , { he  }  [ 11 ] \",\n"," \"Uh-huh . { Putin  }  [ 1 ] came this time bringing more than 100 people , such a large delegation , to { Japan  }  [ 2 ] . { He  }  [ 1 ] still intends to solicit businesses and investment , to use our Chinese expression , yet this intention is very obvious . Right , right . Right , I think . However , based on this outcome , the form still seems to have outdone the content . I think that with regard to { Japan  }  [ 2 ] 's relations with { Russia  }  [ 3 ] , it has been like this since the 1970s . When { Tanaka Kakuei  }  [ 4 ] went there , { he  }  [ 4 ] also did this . I will invest , I will give you aid to develop eastern Siberia . That 's because { Russia  }  [ 3 ] has a vast area of land . We know { the population  }  [ 5 ] is small , that is to say { they  }  [ 6 ] can not develop { it  }  [ 5 ] . That is , the treasure is all hidden underground . Well , at that time , , { they  }  [ 6 ] still wanted to solve the population problem . Uh-huh . So , that is , { Japan  }  [ 2 ] \",\n"," \"Yes , , eh , just now Director Xing mentioned a very important issue , that is , the nationalist sentiment . In fact , regarding { Putin  }  [ 1 ] { Putin 's visit to Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan  }  [ 3 ] this time , the media earlier predicted , among other things , that when the time came , there would be more than 60 groups totaling more than 700 people , along with , hey , more than 200 propaganda trucks on the streets of downtown Tokyo , to protest against { Putin  }  [ 1 ] { Putin 's visit to Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan  }  [ 3 ] . Well , what forces do { these people and groups holding street protests  }  [ 4 ] represent ? What are { they  }  [ 4 ] asking for ? And what impact will it have on { Putin  }  [ 1 ] { Putin 's visit to Japan  }  [ 2 ] { Japan  }  [ 3 ] ? Okay . { They  }  [ 4 ] are some focused right - wing groups , similar to a gang society . But , with regard to this Russian issue , ah , this can not be simply regarded as a handful of people making trouble , because there are widespread historical grievances among ordinary people in { Japan  }  [ 3 ] against { Russia  }  [ 5 ] . I have had contact with many Japanese . That is to say , { this  }  [ 6 ] involves the origin of the { Northern Territories  }  [ 7 ] issue . Well , I think { it  }  [ 6 ] originated a long time ago and involves three major issues . One is that historically and legally , { it  }  [ 6 ] has changed several times . For instance , in 1855 , in 1875 , and in 1905 after the Russo - Japanese War , and also WW II , at these critical points , ownership of { the territories  }  [ 7 ] was constantly changing . With ancestors constantly changing , { both sides  }  [ 8 ] had { their  }  [ 8 ] own arguments . In fact , ownership of { the Northern Territories  }  [ 7 ] has changed several times , and there has been no single law . Therefore , there is truth on { both sides  }  [ 8 ] . Uh-huh . Now { Russia  }  [ 5 ] says this was the result of WWII international laws and treaties , with the US also recognizing it at that time . Uh-huh . The entire international community recognizes that { the four islands  }  [ 9 ] should belong to { Russia  }  [ 5 ] . Both the Yalta Agreement and Article 2 of the San Francisco Treaty recognize { Japan  }  [ 10 ] 's relinquishment of { the Kuril Islands  }  [ 9 ] . However , then there is a lot of nationalist sentiment , that is , { Japan  }  [ 10 ] believes that the Soviet Union unilaterally broke the Pact of Neutrality , sending troops into Northeast China and defeating the Kwantung Army . For things like this , as { Japan  }  [ 10 ] \",\n"," \"Yeah . Just now you mentioned the origin of { the four northern islands  }  [ 1 ] . Well , today we have been talking about { the four northern islands issue  }  [ 2 ] . Well , how exactly did { the four northern islands issue  }  [ 2 ] originate ? Let 's learn something about { it  }  [ 2 ] . { The four islands , Iturup , Shikotan , the Khabomai Rocks , and Kunashir  }  [ 3 ] , are located in the northern part of the western Pacific Ocean , with a total area of about 5,000 square kilometers , which { Japan  }  [ 4 ] calls { the four northern islands  }  [ 1 ] , and { Russia  }  [ 5 ] calls Southern Chishima . { Their  }  [ 3 ] surrounding sea waters have a great wealth of fishing resources and undersea mineral deposits , with highly important strategic positions . The ownership of { these four islands  }  [ 1 ] has long been a dead knot in Russian - Japanese relations that has been difficult to untie . In August 1945 , the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in succession . To ask { the Soviet Union  }  [ 5 ] to declare war against { Japan  }  [ 4 ] , the US and Britain gave { Russia  }  [ 5 ] the Chishima Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin Island , which { Japan  }  [ 4 ] occupied at the time . In 1955 { the Soviet Union  }  [ 5 ] and { Japan  }  [ 4 ] began negotiations regarding the normalization of relations . { The then Soviet Union  }  [ 5 ] { Soviet Union  }  [ 5 ] indicated willingness to return { the Khabomai Rocks  }  [ 6 ] { the Khabomai Rocks and Shikotan  }  [ 7 ] { Shikotan  }  [ 8 ] . Yet { Japan  }  [ 4 ] requested that { the Soviet Union  }  [ 5 ] return Iturup and Kunashiri as well . { It  }  [ 4 ] also requested that { the Soviet Union  }  [ 5 ] promise to attend the international peace conference to determine the ownership of Sakhalin and { the entire Chishima Islands  }  [ 9 ] . Negotiations broke down as a result . In 1956 , { the then Soviet Union  }  [ 5 ] { Soviet Union  }  [ 5 ] restated { its  }  [ 5 ] willingness to return { the Khabomai Rocks  }  [ 6 ] { the Khabomai Rocks and Shikotan  }  [ 7 ] { Shikotan  }  [ 8 ] . { Japan  }  [ 4 ] again said that unless { the four islands  }  [ 9 ] were returned together , the Soviet proposal could definitely not be accepted . For a long time , { Japanese - Russian  }  [ 10 ] relations have not made breakthrough progress due to { the deadlocked four northern islands issue  }  [ 11 ] . Today , already more than 50 years after the end of WW II , { the two nations  }  [ 12 ] have still not signed a peace treaty realizing the complete normalization of bilateral relations . In the literal sense , if { the two nations  }  [ 12 ] have not signed a peace treaty , { it  }  [ 12 ] means at this point { the two nations  }  [ 12 ] are still at war . As the two experts are constantly discussing , saying that { the four northern islands issue  }  [ 11 ] is a dead knot in { Japanese - Russian  }  [ 10 ] relations , yet { this dead knot  }  [ 13 ] , it seems that currently { both sides  }  [ 14 ] have this idea , { they  }  [ 14 ] want to untie { this dead knot  }  [ 13 ] . Well , we noticed , er , just now { this short clip  }  [ 15 ] also talked about { it  }  [ 15 ] , at that time { the Soviet Union  }  [ 16 ] agreed to return two islands first , , but , eh , { Japan  }  [ 4 ] never agreed . But now , we also notice that , Taro Aso proposed a new idea , the joint development that { the Soviet Union  }  [ 16 ] had previously talked about . Well , can this point lead to a breakthrough in { the two nations '  }  [ 12 ] resolution of { the four northern islands issue  }  [ 11 ] \",\n"," \"I think it is very hard , as joint development and sovereignty of the islands are , ah , two concepts . It wo n't work , either , eh , eh . But this is relevant . Uh-huh . Oh , as I just mentioned , { it  }  [ 1 ] was against a large background that { Russia  }  [ 2 ] first proposed { it  }  [ 1 ] . Uh-huh . With , quite a troubled economy , { Russia  }  [ 2 ] needed Japanese investment , needed Japan to get involved through this channel . Uh-huh . Well , now that { its  }  [ 2 ] economy has greatly improved , { Russia  }  [ 2 ] does not need to take this diplomatic risk . Uh-huh . This is one . Second , { Russia  }  [ 2 ] should be seen as a rather strong nation . Well , this place , the four northern islands , is a very sensitive region for { the Russian psyche  }  [ 4 ] { Russian  }  [ 3 ] psyche . Any small , small diplomatic or economic action will affect { the psyche of Russian citizens  }  [ 4 ] { Russian  }  [ 3 ] \",\n"," \"Uh-huh . So , well , { Putin  }  [ 1 ] 's visit to { Japan  }  [ 2 ] this time , or during { his  }  [ 1 ] visit to { Japan  }  [ 2 ] , or prior to this , there were rallies in the Far East region , including the Sakhalin area , meant to give many warnings to { Putin  }  [ 1 ] . Uh-huh . Well , { Russian  }  [ 3 ] politicians also made many appeals regarding this . Well , one { Russian  }  [ 3 ] politician stated very clearly that while { Russia  }  [ 4 ] 's territory is vast , { Russia  }  [ 4 ] does not have territories to spare . This is a very , very , eh , tough kind of issue . Well , as I just said very clearly , that is to say , in addition to the legal and historical complications , the repeated change of ownership , and then national sentiments as well , { the four northern islands  }  [ 5 ] are also strategically very important . That is , does n't { Russia  }  [ 4 ] advocate a double - headed eagle policy ? Right , right . It is both a European and Asian nation . Well , if { he  }  [ 1 ] wants development in Asia , wo n't { he  }  [ 1 ] close the door if { he  }  [ 1 ] loses hold of { the four northern islands  }  [ 5 ] now ? Uh-huh . Fisheries . { The four northern islands  }  [ 5 ] not only have mineral deposits , oil , and fisheries , but also for military strategy , { they  }  [ 5 ] are key positions in { the Pacific Ocean  }  [ 6 ] . In { the Pacific Ocean  }  [ 6 ] , right . Currently { Russia  }  [ 4 ] seems to be in a period of low tide , but { it  }  [ 4 ] wo n't stay this way forever . Right , right , right . { It  }  [ 7 ] is still a large nation . { It  }  [ 7 ] is still a large nation . { It  }  [ 7 ] is also an international power . Therefore , none of { its  }  [ 4 ] leaders can easily give away { the four northern islands  }  [ 5 ] . let me again add some words , if { it  }  [ 4 ] wants joint development , { Japanese  }  [ 8 ] companies and { Japanese  }  [ 8 ] influence will enter { the four northern islands  }  [ 5 ] . Right , right . Well , after entering , , economic influence may lead to political influence . Currently that would seem to benefit { Japan  }  [ 9 ] . Yes . { It  }  [ 10 ] would benefit { Japan  }  [ 9 ] . { Russia  }  [ 4 ] has foreseen the consequences . That 's why { Russia  }  [ 4 ] now rejects { it  }  [ 10 ] . { It  }  [ 10 ] was originally proposed by { Russia  }  [ 4 ] , but rejected by { Japan  }  [ 9 ] \",\n"," \"Uh-huh . Well , since { the four northern islands issue  }  [ 1 ] is a dead knot in bilateral relations that can not be untied , and also { both  }  [ 2 ] are working hard , yet with seemingly little hope in sight , well , how can { Japanese - Russian  }  [ 3 ] relations develop under such circumstances ? I think { both sides  }  [ 2 ] generally know { the two sides '  }  [ 2 ] levels of political operations , knowing that territorial issues are hard to resolve . So , with { this issue  }  [ 1 ] having gone on for many years , { both sides  }  [ 2 ] may have a bottom line . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . That is , { they  }  [ 2 ] wo n't say { we  }  [ 2 ] will stay opposed to each other as long as it is unresolved . Uh-huh . So it may be like this . That is to say , in the future { both sides  }  [ 2 ] may become more reasonable on { this issue  }  [ 1 ] . That is , looking farther ahead , normalization of relations will still be gradually developed . Uh-huh . That is , do n't always get stuck on { the territorial issue  }  [ 1 ] . But on the other hand , { the territorial issue  }  [ 1 ] is also quite important and sensitive . So { it  }  [ 1 ] is unrealistic for you to say there will be breakthrough progress in { Japanese - Russian  }  [ 3 ] { Japanese - Russian relations  }  [ 4 ] and that { their  }  [ 2 ] economic and trade relations will suddenly achieve 100 billion . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So the prospects for { Japanese - Russian  }  [ 3 ] { Japanese - Russian relations  }  [ 4 ] \",\n"," \"Uh-huh . That is , { Russian - Japanese  }  [ 1 ] relations , from the perspective of { Russia  }  [ 2 ] , I do n't see many changes in the large framework of { Russian - Japanese  }  [ 1 ] { Russian - Japanese relations  }  [ 3 ] . Well , Mr. Xing , how do you view { Russian - Japanese  }  [ 1 ] { Russian - Japanese relations  }  [ 3 ] ? That is to say , these basic tones have been set . The main issue is the four northern islands . However , current signs show that { Russia  }  [ 2 ] { Russia and Japan  }  [ 4 ] { Japan  }  [ 5 ] are moving forward on economic issues , on economic cooperation . Uh-huh . Yes . I will give two examples . One example is that this year Toyota Motor has invested in St. Petersburg . Uh-huh . In addition , { Putin  }  [ 6 ] attended the ribbon - cutting ceremony . This is , quite a clear signal . That is to say , -- { Japan  }  [ 5 ] has now invested in { Russia  }  [ 2 ] . Second , what { Japan  }  [ 5 ] hopes to get is , hey , { Russia  }  [ 2 ] 's oil . Uh-huh . Though { Russia  }  [ 2 ] did not make a final commitment , there is already a general framework . Uh-huh . That is to say , eventually { Russia  }  [ 2 ] 's oil pipeline will be connected to a Pacific Ocean port , which will benefit { Japan  }  [ 5 ] . Uh-huh . That is , although there are obstacles in bilateral relations , { they  }  [ 4 ] are still exploring forward movement . Right . Uh-huh . Okay , well , today { we  }  [ 7 ] will end { our  }  [ 7 ] discussion here on the topic of { Putin  }  [ 6 ] 's visit to { Japan  }  [ 5 ] .

On November 22 , the British newspaper Daily Mirror revealed that { US President Bush  }  [ 1 ] once planned to bomb the al - Jazeera TV station headquarters , setting off a mighty uproar . The two { British  }  [ 2 ] nationals charged with leaking the information already appeared in court for interrogation yesterday for the first time . According to a report by the British newspaper the Guardian , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 3 ] is now considering suing { US President Bush  }  [ 1 ] for this matter . Well , what exactly was { this incident  }  [ 4 ] ? Why has { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 3 ] become a thorn in { Bush  }  [ 1 ] 's side ? These are all the topics we will be focusing on today . Two honorable guests have been invited to { our  }  [ 5 ] { our studio  }  [ 6 ] . Let me give you an introduction . One is { Mr. Ruan Zongze , vice director of the China Institute of International Studies  }  [ 7 ] . { Mr. Ruan Zongze  }  [ 7 ] has done extensive researches on { British  }  [ 2 ] and US issues . The other is Mr. Wu Huixuan , former CIR chief correspondent based in Qatar . Hello ! Welcome you two to { the studio  }  [ 6 ] for { our  }  [ 5 ] interview . Well , at the start of today 's program , let 's learn about the full context of { this incident  }  [ 4 ] together . { We  }  [ 8 ] will first talk about { the Daily Mirror article that started it  }  [ 10 ] { Daily Mirror  }  [ 9 ] article that started { it  }  [ 9 ] . What { we  }  [ 8 ] are seeing now on screen is a very popular newspaper in Britain called the Daily Mirror . Next , let 's see ; this is a November 22 article . The title goes like this : Exclusive report : { Bush  }  [ 1 ] Planned to Bomb { his  }  [ 1 ] Arab Ally, Well , let 's now look at the content of { the article  }  [ 10 ] . { The article  }  [ 10 ] writes that the minutes of a meeting between { British  }  [ 2 ] Prime Minister Blair , who was visiting the US on April 16 , 2004 , and US President Bush at the White House showed that { Bush  }  [ 1 ] had intended to take military actions against al - Jazeera TV station headquartered in the Qatari capital of Doha . Then , Blair said to { Bush  }  [ 1 ] \",\n"," \"Let { 's  }  [ 1 ] now look at this article . let { 's  }  [ 1 ] look at this line marked with a black frame , which writes : Undoubtedly { Bush  }  [ 2 ] wanted to do { this  }  [ 3 ] . And equally without doubt , Blair did not want { him  }  [ 2 ] , that is , { Bush  }  [ 2 ] , to do { this  }  [ 3 ] . Well , { it  }  [ 3 ] happened , er , that { our  }  [ 4 ] correspondent did an interview at the al - Jazeera 's Beijing office today and happened to videotape the image { we  }  [ 4 ] are watching now , which was broadcast live by { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 5 ] . It was the news about { Bush  }  [ 2 ] 's plan to bomb { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 5 ] . So what we are seeing on screen was exactly transmitted by { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 5 ] . Well , yesterday the two British nationals involved in the disclosure of { the incident  }  [ 6 ] were interrogated by the court . Well , here is the scene of the two persons under interrogation . In the meantime , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 5 ] also protested several times upon learning the information . Well , this is a brief introduction of the context of { the incident  }  [ 6 ] . Well , regarding this topic , the first question today is that we want to find out clearly whether { this incident  }  [ 6 ] was real or not . Let 's start with this newspaper . Well , Director Yuan , I know that you also once worked in Britain . Well , what kind of newspaper is { the Daily Mirror  }  [ 7 ] ? { It  }  [ 7 ] is said to have a very large circulation , but people still call { it  }  [ 7 ] a tabloid . So how accurate is the news carried by { it  }  [ 7 ] ? This is true . { Its  }  [ 7 ] circulation should be considered one of the largest among British newspapers . Uh-huh . But at the same time , interestingly , it is not a mainstream newspaper , either . Uh-huh . That is why { it  }  [ 7 ] is called a tabloid , because { it  }  [ 7 ] does not belong to the mainstream in the current British newspaper industry . { It  }  [ 7 ] is still called a tabloid . { It  }  [ 7 ] is placed together with other city newspapers , yet { it  }  [ 7 ] \",\n"," \"{ Its  }  [ 1 ] influence is mainly on ordinary readers , the general public . That 's because { most British newspapers  }  [ 2 ] have { their  }  [ 2 ] own steady readership . { They  }  [ 2 ] have different levels of readership , ah . Right , { they  }  [ 2 ] have a fairly steady readership . Right . Well , { this newspaper  }  [ 1 ] is said to have various kinds of topics appropriate to all ages . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Well , so , now we need to seriously consider { its  }  [ 1 ] authenticity or accuracy . Is the news carried by { it  }  [ 3 ] credible or not ? How much is { its  }  [ 3 ] accuracy , I think , is still quite hard to determine at this time , indeed , Uh-huh . because I will mainly speak from two perspectives . First , when { the Mirror  }  [ 3 ] got hold of { the news  }  [ 4 ] , { it  }  [ 3 ] called { 10 Downing Street  }  [ 5 ] the first night , saying that { it  }  [ 3 ] had such information . Uh-huh , uh-huh . Well , { it  }  [ 3 ] meant to find out whether { 10 Downing Street  }  [ 5 ] had anything to say , but { Downing Street  }  [ 5 ] said { it  }  [ 5 ] had no comments . Uh-huh . However , when { the news  }  [ 4 ] was released , { it  }  [ 4 ] set off such a mighty uproar . Uh-huh . This is the first point . The second point is to look at the reaction of { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 6 ] . { What al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 6 ] is now asking { Britain  }  [ 7 ] to do is to either confirm { the news  }  [ 4 ] as true or to deny { it  }  [ 4 ] . Uh-huh , uh-huh . However , right now , { Britain  }  [ 7 ] has neither said it is true nor said { it  }  [ 8 ] is not . That is the situation . { It  }  [ 8 ] did not confirm anything . However , there is still one detail . When { we  }  [ 9 ] introduced the context information , { we  }  [ 9 ] also mentioned { the two staff members involved in the leakage of the information  }  [ 10 ] . { These two staff members  }  [ 10 ] , also considered British government employees , have already been under interrogation . Well , since { they  }  [ 10 ] are under interrogation , it means { they  }  [ 10 ] \",\n"," 'Could this be used to determine that there was indeed such an incident ? There was such an incident , um , uh-huh . I think there are two questions involved in this matter . One is whether there is any secret being divulged , and the other is whether the news that { Bush  }  [ 1 ] wanted to bomb { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] is true . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . I think these are two different questions . Uh-huh . Regarding the leakage of { the secret  }  [ 3 ] , it seems that the possibility here , ah , is really big . { What secret exactly  }  [ 3 ] was divulged ? Um . Because according to { the British , um , government  }  [ 4 ] , um , { its  }  [ 4 ] Official Secrets Act Section 5 , that is to say , { it  }  [ 4 ] is illegal for newspapers or media to publicize indiscreetly government information obtained through unauthorized channels . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , well , { these two people  }  [ 5 ] have already been suspected of violating this section , and that is why { they  }  [ 5 ] have been sued . Right . Well , of course it is still in a preliminary stage right now , and yesterday a hearing lasting only 15 minutes was held . Uh-huh . But , { both of these two people  }  [ 5 ] { these two people  }  [ 5 ] denied { they  }  [ 5 ] were guilty . Uh-huh . So , now it will still have to go through a quite lengthy judicial procedure . Eh , in other words , although { they  }  [ 5 ] were interrogated , whether the secret leaked was something like our topic today , that is , { Bush  }  [ 1 ] said { he  }  [ 1 ] wanted to bomb { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] , whether the secret divulged was this record , these are still two different things . However , it should be closely related to this because this is about { the so - called memo  }  [ 6 ] . Uh-huh . It should be closely related . Yeah . Uh-huh . On April 16 of last year when { Blair  }  [ 7 ] was visiting the US , { they  }  [ 8 ] had some exchange between { them  }  [ 8 ] . That was how { this memo  }  [ 6 ] came into being . { It  }  [ 6 ] was about five pages long . Right . Uh-huh . Well , in { this memo  }  [ 6 ] , { Bush  }  [ 1 ] seemed to imply that { he  }  [ 1 ] probably wanted to bomb { this al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . At that time { Blair  }  [ 7 ] tried { his  }  [ 7 ] best to persuade { him  }  [ 1 ] not to do { it  }  [ 2 ] . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , but the very authenticity of the incident , I think , still needs to be determined by { the British government or US government  }  [ 9 ] . { They  }  [ 9 ] ',\n"," \"Yeah . Well , Mr. Wu , we know , ah , you worked as a reporter in { Qatar  }  [ 1 ] and were very familiar with { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] . So how do you look at { this incident  }  [ 3 ] ? Do you think { it  }  [ 3 ] is real or not ? Um . I think { it  }  [ 3 ] is possible that { the US  }  [ 4 ] wanted to bomb { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] . Uh-huh . That 's because all the things reported by { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] since { its  }  [ 2 ] establishment in 1996 were those { the US  }  [ 4 ] did not want viewers in the world to look at , { especially with respect to the Afghan war and Iraq war  }  [ 5 ] . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . What { they  }  [ 5 ] reported was entirely incompatible with the so - called freedom of the press advocated by { the US  }  [ 4 ] . Uh-huh . For instance , { the US  }  [ 4 ] attacked { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] several times . It happened once that when Bush , er , together with that Defense Secretary Rumsfeld visited { Qatar  }  [ 1 ] , they , put pressure on { the Qatari government  }  [ 6 ] , saying you should not broadcast these news items that were harmful to { the US  }  [ 4 ] . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , later , under such circumstances , eh , the director of { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] was replaced once . Uh-huh . Under his pressure . Uh-huh . But , the leader of { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] , Jazeera , ah , { Qatar  }  [ 1 ] replied that { we  }  [ 1 ] advocate the same freedom of the press as the freedom of the press in your country and that { our  }  [ 1 ] { our government  }  [ 6 ] has no right to interfere with what is being reported by a private TV station . That is to say , eh , according to your judgment , { this incident  }  [ 7 ] was possible because { the US  }  [ 4 ] has long considered { it  }  [ 7 ] a thorn in { its  }  [ 7 ] flesh .Right . So , to say that the US government or the US president had such an idea , you think many people may easily believe it . Yeah . There is such possibility . Right , yes . All right , regarding whether { this incident  }  [ 7 ] was real or not , according to you two , eh , there is indeed a lot of information . There are { no waves without wind  }  [ 8 ] . Yeah . Right , there are { no waves without wind  }  [ 8 ] . So , { this incident  }  [ 7 ] \",\n"," \"Well , let 's now focus on { this al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 1 ] . As a matter of fact , when we watch TV , we can see many news services , ah , including the US CNN and the British BBC , often replaying footage by { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 1 ] . Since { the al - Jazeera TV station logo  }  [ 2 ] is on , people should be quite familiar with { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 1 ] . { The station logo  }  [ 2 ] , right . Yeah . But how did { this al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 1 ] rise to fame competing with so many Western media outlets in news coverage ? Let 's learn about this through another background video clip . Al - Jazeera TV station , established in November 1996 in { Qatar  }  [ 3 ] , is an Arabic - language news TV station broadcasting global news and reports nonstop around the clock . { Its  }  [ 1 ] staff all comes from various Arab countries , and { its  }  [ 1 ] viewership has reached 50 million . Prior to { its  }  [ 1 ] establishment , there has been no Arabic - language TV station broadcasting news nonstop around the clock in { the Arab world  }  [ 4 ] . In September 2001 , the 9 / 11 attacks broke out in the US . On October 7 , the US and Britain launched military strikes on the Taliban in { Afghanistan  }  [ 5 ] . As a result , { another news war  }  [ 6 ] erupted in the international media community . When { people all over the world  }  [ 7 ] { all over the world  }  [ 8 ] { the world  }  [ 4 ] expected to watch the live broadcast of { the war  }  [ 6 ] by the US CNN , { they  }  [ 7 ] could only see a few blurry images on TV . Meanwhile , however , { the little known al - Jazeera TV station based in the small Gulf country of Qatar  }  [ 9 ] { Qatar  }  [ 3 ] suddenly emerged to broadcast the progress of the Afghan war in Arabic language and mobilized { its  }  [ 9 ] 27 reporting stations { all over the world  }  [ 8 ] { the world  }  [ 4 ] to conduct an around - the - clock follow up coverage . When the Taliban regime announced that reporters from all countries were banned from entering the territory of { Afghanistan  }  [ 5 ] , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 10 ] was the only one that could enter the Taliban - controlled area . Taking such an advantage , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 10 ] started to establish { its  }  [ 10 ] unique leading position in covering { the Afghan war  }  [ 11 ] with { its  }  [ 10 ] frequent live broadcast of missile attacks on the Afghan capital of Kabul . During { the war  }  [ 11 ] , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 10 ] continued to broadcast exclusive news and images under { its  }  [ 10 ] logo and sell { them  }  [ 10 ] to competitors at the high price of 20,000 US dollars per minute . While the US military searched everywhere for information on { bin Laden  }  [ 12 ] in vain , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 10 ] frequently aired the footage of { bin Laden  }  [ 12 ] \",\n"," \"Mr. Wu , we know that you happened to be in { Qatar  }  [ 1 ] when { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] was just established in 1996 . Right . In addition , you were said to have attended { the inaugural broadcast ceremony  }  [ 3 ] . What did { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] look like when { it  }  [ 2 ] just started broadcasting ? What kind of news broadcast style was featured at { that time  }  [ 4 ] ? Er , { they  }  [ 2 ] held an inaugural broadcast ceremony at the end of November 1996 at { that time  }  [ 4 ] . We reporters in { Qatar  }  [ 1 ] were also invited to attend { this inaugural broadcast ceremony  }  [ 3 ] . Uh-huh . There were n't many people at the time . Uh-huh . But at the time of { its  }  [ 2 ] establishment , this , er , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] already had a very good foundation in terms of reporters . Uh-huh . Why ? In 1995 , um , { the British BBC 's Arabic Language TV Station  }  [ 2 ] was shut down due to funding problems . Uh-huh . So , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] seized this opportunity to get hold of , { this entire group of people  }  [ 5 ] by hiring { them  }  [ 5 ] , er , as { their  }  [ 2 ] reporters , editors , or anchors at high salaries . Uh-huh . So , { they  }  [ 2 ] had a relatively good team of reporters . Uh-huh . Well , this way , later it followed that , er , er , , , er , six - Chinese - character principle of news reporting called , er , independence , neutrality , ah , neutrality , balance , and freedom . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , what { it  }  [ 2 ] reported was in a completely different style from that of some other Arab TV stations . Right . In this respect , that is , let me add one point , that is , this al - Jazeera TV station , ah , { its  }  [ 2 ] style is very much characterized by direct borrowing from the West , for instance , the two mainstream media outlets . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Right . Uh-huh . One is CNN , and the other is { BBC  }  [ 6 ] . Yeah . Well , I think that { BBC  }  [ 6 ] , in particular , has quite a big influence on { it  }  [ 7 ] .Just now , that is to say , many of { its  }  [ 7 ] \",\n"," \"Uh-huh . That was jointly run by { BBC  }  [ 1 ] and { Saudi Arabia  }  [ 2 ] . So { it  }  [ 3 ] had a very good foundation . In addition , that is , actually , { this al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 3 ] has a quite unique structure . That 's because { the emir of this country  }  [ 4 ] { this country  }  [ 2 ] is called Hamad . { He  }  [ 4 ] studied in { Britain  }  [ 5 ] and therefore had quite a good knowledge of { Britain 's BBC TV station  }  [ 3 ] { Britain  }  [ 5 ] 's BBC TV station . { He  }  [ 4 ] also quite admired { it  }  [ 3 ] . So , in this way , { it  }  [ 3 ] has borrowed some of the { BBC  }  [ 1 ] style . For instance , { Britain 's BBC  }  [ 1 ] { Britain  }  [ 5 ] 's { BBC  }  [ 1 ] is a very old TV group established in 1927 . Uh-huh . Though { it  }  [ 1 ] is funded by { the government  }  [ 6 ] with many of { its  }  [ 1 ] properties owned by { the government  }  [ 6 ] , { it  }  [ 1 ] still follows the guideline of editorial independence . Uh-huh . For instance , the top decision - making body of { BBC  }  [ 1 ] is called the board of directors which are composed of twelve members directly appointed by the Queen . Uh-huh . So { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 3 ] has also adopted this structure . { It  }  [ 3 ] has a top seven - member board of directors . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . However , even if { its  }  [ 3 ] property , ah , and funds can come from { the government  }  [ 6 ] , { it  }  [ 3 ] still relatively has { its  }  [ 3 ] editorial independence . Eh , but in essence , Mr. Wu , is { it  }  [ 3 ] really a private TV station or a government - run TV station ? Er , they themselves claim that { it  }  [ 3 ] is a private TV station , but in reality { it  }  [ 3 ] could not have been established without a large amount of financial support given by { the government  }  [ 6 ] . That 's because { it  }  [ 3 ] , eh , has an extremely small number of ads during { its  }  [ 3 ] around the clock , ah , TV broadcast . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , in addition , { it  }  [ 3 ] has such a large team , especially with high , high , er , wages , and reporters based abroad , so many reporters abroad . If { the government  }  [ 6 ] had not supported such expenditures , eh , it would be impossible for a private TV station to survive . According to your knowledge , how much is { its  }  [ 3 ] yearly expenditure ? It was said that the yearly expenditures seem to be about 7 billion US dollars . About 7 billion US dollars , that is equivalent to more than 50 billion RMB . We should say { this  }  [ 7 ] is a very huge financial expenditure .Uh-huh . Extremely large . Yeah . Therefore , some people call { it  }  [ 7 ] gaining voice but losing money because { it  }  [ 7 ] has relatively small revenues due to few ads . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . But { it  }  [ 7 ] has a tremendous influence . Right . So , { it  }  [ 7 ] appears that { it  }  [ 7 ] is still not bad in gaining voice as { it  }  [ 7 ] \",\n"," 'Ha . Well , speaking of { its  }  [ 1 ] influence , we have also noticed that er , during { the Afghan war  }  [ 2 ] , er , because { it  }  [ 1 ] has the exclusive interview right to enter Afghanistan to conduct independent and exclusive interviews , we could say { this  }  [ 3 ] is one of { its  }  [ 3 ] advantages . Uh-huh . { It  }  [ 1 ] also presented an opportunity to { it  }  [ 1 ] as well . Well , to the development of a TV station , both opportunity and real strength are actually very important . Well , as { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 4 ] has been able to develop into { its  }  [ 4 ] current status , what do you think has { it  }  [ 4 ] relied upon so that { its  }  [ 4 ] competitiveness and influential power , even surpassed CNN and BBC during { the Iraq war  }  [ 5 ] ? The greatest feature of { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 4 ] is that { it  }  [ 4 ] is a small station that competes with large ones and has become well - known through wars . That is , the reason why { it  }  [ 4 ] can establish { itself  }  [ 4 ] is that { it  }  [ 4 ] first relied on { the Afghan war  }  [ 2 ] , and then { the Iraq war  }  [ 5 ] after the 9 / 11 . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , { it  }  [ 4 ] made full use of these two opportunities . In addition , as { the Iraq war  }  [ 5 ] occurred right in an Arab country , everyone is very much concerned with what is going on in { the war  }  [ 5 ] . So , this provides { it  }  [ 4 ] with a large viewership , making { it  }  [ 4 ] instantly famous . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Besides , { it  }  [ 4 ] has a lot of resources , including { its  }  [ 4 ] exclusive coverage right in Afghanistan as you mentioned just now . Uh-huh , uh-huh . In addition , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 4 ] is actually quite unique in { the Arab region  }  [ 6 ] . For instance , a very tough conflict in { this region  }  [ 6 ] is the conflict between Palestine and Israel . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Well , in general , { Arabs  }  [ 7 ] will not invite the Israeli leader to make a speech on { their  }  [ 7 ] TV . However , for { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 4 ] , { it  }  [ 4 ] could invite Barak , the Israeli prime minister at that time , to deliver a speech at { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 4 ] . { This  }  [ 8 ] was unprecedented in the Arab world . Right . Uh-huh . Well , { this  }  [ 8 ] also gave { it  }  [ 4 ] a very unique perspective . Uh-huh . So , the reason why { it  }  [ 4 ] is successful , to put { it  }  [ 9 ] simply , I think , is that { it  }  [ 9 ] mainly relies on { its  }  [ 9 ] own very professional news team . { It  }  [ 9 ] has a very talented team , eh . Yeah . In addition , { it  }  [ 9 ] also looks at { major events  }  [ 10 ] as { they  }  [ 10 ] ',\n"," \"I think that { favorable opportunities and geographical conditions also helped because people involved in the Afghan war and the Taliban were mostly Arabs  }  [ 1 ] { the Afghan war  }  [ 2 ] and the Taliban were mostly Arabs . Uh-huh . { They  }  [ 1 ] were from Arab countries . { They  }  [ 1 ] spoke the Arabic language . Well , that was the opportunity . In particular , it was the same with the , Iraq war , which took place in { Iraq  }  [ 3 ] . In the , { Iraq war  }  [ 2 ] , as far as I know , among foreign media teams dispatched to { Iraq  }  [ 3 ] for coverage , I should say , the one from { Qatar 's al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 4 ] was the most powerful . Uh-huh . { It  }  [ 4 ] had three reporting stations at that time , one group in the south in Basra , well , one group in Baghdad , and still another group in the north in Mosul . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So { it  }  [ 5 ] was basically covering the , um , Iraq war from all perspectives . So , { it  }  [ 5 ] surely surpassed some Western media in covering { the Iraq war  }  [ 2 ] in certain areas . Uh-huh . We could say { it  }  [ 5 ] owed { its  }  [ 5 ] success to good opportunities , which { it  }  [ 5 ] seized ; Yes . favorable geographical conditions ; that is to say , { it  }  [ 5 ] happens to be located geographically in the Arab world ; Yeah . and also harmonious human conditions ; that is to say , { it  }  [ 5 ] has { its  }  [ 5 ] own very rounded and talented team . Er , that is why { it  }  [ 5 ] is highly influential and competitive . However , as { it  }  [ 5 ] is becoming more and more influential and competitive , { it  }  [ 5 ] has also become a thorn in the US side . Well , today { we  }  [ 6 ] should say { we  }  [ 6 ] \",\n"," \"Well , next let 's learn about more . What conflicts are there between { al - Jazeera TV station and the US  }  [ 1 ] { the US  }  [ 2 ] ? Why has { it  }  [ 3 ] become a thorn in the US side ? Since { it  }  [ 3 ] gained instant fame during the Afghan war , the style of al - Jazeera TV station in pursuit of the freedom of the press and independence has gradually won widespread international attention . However , at the same time , the conflict between { al - Jazeera TV station and the US  }  [ 1 ] { the US  }  [ 2 ] has been increasing . According to reports , { Bush  }  [ 4 ] { Bush , Rumsfeld , and Powell  }  [ 5 ] repeatedly expressed { their  }  [ 5 ] strong displeasure with { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 6 ] directly to the Qatari leaders , demanding { its  }  [ 6 ] { its government  }  [ 7 ] to restrain { it  }  [ 6 ] more firmly . { The US government  }  [ 7 ] thinks that radicals , anti-American and religious commentators have become frequent guests at { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 6 ] . In particular , { bin Laden  }  [ 8 ] has chosen { it  }  [ 6 ] as { his  }  [ 8 ] exclusive information release agency , endowing { it  }  [ 6 ] with a unique advantage . All these made { the US  }  [ 2 ] hate and fear { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 6 ] at the same time . Officials of the { Bush  }  [ 4 ] administration called { it  }  [ 6 ] Osama 's TV station on different occasions because { bin Laden  }  [ 8 ] { bin Laden 's  }  [ 8 ] full name is { Osama bin Laden  }  [ 8 ] . During { the Iraq war  }  [ 9 ] , { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 6 ] not only broadcast { Bush  }  [ 4 ] 's and Blair 's impassioned pre-war speeches and the image of coalition troops marching toward Iraq , but also broadcast the bloody bodies of civilians next to bombed cars . The video camera scanned over the corpses of coalition troops killed by the Iraqi military , and over { that little tearful boy with bandages around his head  }  [ 10 ] { his  }  [ 10 ] head , crying . If you see the war on the US TV as an electronic game and grand display of smoke and fire , then from the footage by { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 6 ] , you see the war only as hell . Do you still remember , ah , during the Afghan war and { the Iraq war  }  [ 9 ] , we could often see on screen the al - Jazeera footage such as { bin Laden  }  [ 8 ] and some other { al - Qaeda  }  [ 11 ] leaders giving speeches . Ah , moreover , the footage that many other TV stations were using also basically came from { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 6 ] . Therefore , at that time Americans , said that since { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 6 ] broadcast these activities of terrorists , { it  }  [ 6 ] must be colluding with terrorists . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . So , it was always thought that there seemed to be some subtle relationship between al - Jazeera TV station and { al - Qaeda  }  [ 11 ] \",\n"," \"Right , Mr. Wu , how do you look at this issue ? This may have something to do with the good opportunities and favorable geographical conditions mentioned earlier . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Since , er , { the Taliban people  }  [ 1 ] were all Arabs , { they  }  [ 1 ] tried by various means to gain the information so as to expand { their  }  [ 1 ] own influence . This has been the consistent practice of al - Jazeera station . Uh-huh . Well , the same goes with { the Iraq war  }  [ 2 ] . { They  }  [ 3 ] , eh , also speak Arabic , right ? Another Arabic nationality . Uh-huh . What { they  }  [ 3 ] reported , eh , was very much welcomed and favored by Arab viewers . Uh-huh . That 's because what { they  }  [ 3 ] have reported can not be found in the Western media reports . That 's why { their  }  [ 3 ] { their fame  }  [ 4 ] grows . That is to say , { it  }  [ 4 ] indeed inspires a kind of patriotic or nationalistic sentiments among Arab countries . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . I think , this point is very important . In other words , { it  }  [ 4 ] also benefits from the hard work of { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 5 ] . That is , it is from the perspective of Arabs that { it  }  [ 4 ] looks at { the war  }  [ 2 ] or also looks at major events . So , when { it  }  [ 4 ] makes a report , { its  }  [ 4 ] perspective , analysis , and { its  }  [ 4 ] possible outcome or some process of { its  }  [ 4 ] analysis are different from those of reports by the Western mainstream media such as CNN and BBC . Well , it is exactly because of this , even if { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 5 ] may not be necessarily linked with any other organizations , simply because { it  }  [ 5 ] reports { the war  }  [ 2 ] using a different voice , { it  }  [ 5 ] \",\n"," \"Well , regarding this incident , what kind of reaction did { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 1 ] have ? { We  }  [ 2 ] do n't have much information right now . But when { our  }  [ 2 ] { our correspondents  }  [ 3 ] went to have an interview at the al - Jazeera TV station 's Beijing office today , { they  }  [ 3 ] asked { their  }  [ 3 ] { their office administrator named Ezzat  }  [ 4 ] , ah , the question why the US threatened to bomb { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 1 ] ? { He  }  [ 4 ] is also a China expert and speaks excellent Chinese . Let 's hear what { he  }  [ 4 ] said .-- In { the Middle East region  }  [ 5 ] , in particular , currently , , some US officials , for instance , { many Democrat officials  }  [ 6 ] , { they  }  [ 6 ] admitted that the US policies on Iraq and the Middle East , eh , region have many mistakes . Er , this point must be acknowledged . However , up till now , er , { the Bush administration  }  [ 7 ] , { they  }  [ 7 ] did not want to assume responsibility for what { they  }  [ 7 ] have done there . So , { it  }  [ 7 ] wanted to blame { its  }  [ 7 ] mistakes in { this region  }  [ 5 ] on { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 1 ] . Second , it is because some things are in conflict with { its  }  [ 7 ] interests . However , when I report , I do n't report for the sake of making somebody happy or not making somebody unhappy . This is not my principle , nor is my job . Some of the footage { we  }  [ 8 ] broadcast did not conform to { its  }  [ 7 ] interests . So { it  }  [ 7 ] started to put this restrictive measure in retaliation . So , the issue is not that { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 1 ] is making anti-American reports . In addition , the US government is carrying out some measures and work against these people in { the Middle East region  }  [ 5 ] and against the world peace . As you know , { we  }  [ 8 ] were , eh , reporting the war in { Fallujah  }  [ 9 ] . { Our  }  [ 8 ] { Our reporter  }  [ 10 ] also , eh , almost had an accident there as several shots were purposely , er , fired at { him  }  [ 10 ] . Then , in { the end  }  [ 11 ] , er , { Secretary Rumsfeld  }  [ 10 ] also directly blamed { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 1 ] . Er , , er , most of what { the reporter  }  [ 10 ] said , er , was groundless . In { the end  }  [ 11 ] , later , did { we  }  [ 8 ] say anything later ? { We  }  [ 8 ] stopped talking . { We  }  [ 8 ] then showed viewers facts and let { the images  }  [ 12 ] speak by { themselves  }  [ 12 ] . { We  }  [ 8 ] did not do anything at that time . { Our  }  [ 8 ] reporters were forced not to make any commentaries or any reports . { We  }  [ 8 ] simply showed people the footage about { Fallujah }  [ 9 ] \",\n"," \"Well , the facts may not conform to the interests of { Mr. Bush  }  [ 1 ] . Uh-huh , uh-huh . In fact { he  }  [ 1 ] mentioned a very important point of view here . Ah , Uh-huh. That is to say , { this al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] , due to { its  }  [ 2 ] unique perspective , is different from what is expected of { it  }  [ 2 ] . At { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] , there is , one famous saying , that is , if { the whole world  }  [ 3 ] listens to { CNN  }  [ 4 ] , or { the whole world  }  [ 3 ] watches { CNN  }  [ 4 ] , then whom does { CNN  }  [ 4 ] watch or listen to ? That is also an issue of the right of speech . Well , in fact , { the US  }  [ 5 ] has long been suppressing { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] . For instance , the al Jazeera TV station 's office in { Afghanistan  }  [ 6 ] was bombed in 2001 . Yeah . Uh-huh . Well , in 2003 , { the al - Jazeera TV station 's office in Baghdad  }  [ 7 ] { Baghdad  }  [ 8 ] was also bombed . On April 8 , { its reporting station in Baghdad  }  [ 2 ] { its  }  [ 7 ] reporting station in { Baghdad  }  [ 8 ] was bombed , and one reporter was killed . Yeah . Right . In addition , currently one of { its  }  [ 7 ] reporters is still detained by { the US  }  [ 5 ] at the Guantanamo military base . Right . Eh , it was said that a Sudanese correspondent from { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] , er , was arrested in { Afghanistan  }  [ 6 ] and has been detained ever since at this , er , US military base at Guantanamo . Right . Yeah . We could say that { the US  }  [ 5 ] has been suppressing { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] for quite a long time . Yeah . Well , through what { Ezzat  }  [ 9 ] said { himself  }  [ 9 ] , { he  }  [ 9 ] also thought { he  }  [ 9 ] was innocent . Uh-huh . { He  }  [ 9 ] basically also blamed it on { the US  }  [ 5 ] . Well , will { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] really sue { US President Bush  }  [ 10 ] ? Will { US President Bush  }  [ 10 ] have any occasion or opportunity to have this matter clarified ? Would you please analyze how { this incident  }  [ 11 ] will develop next . I think that right now , { it  }  [ 11 ] has actually entered into a certain judicial procedure in some sense . Uh-huh . That is to say , the British judicial authority has already brought charges against these two officials , er , suspected of disclosing secret documents . Uh-huh . Well , now we have seen that the director of { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 2 ] has also flown to London to demand an explanation from Blair . Uh-huh . To bring up a lawsuit . Right? That is , I think that right now it is more likely to stay for a while as a topic of public commentaries . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . It will stay as a topic of public commentaries , because if { the US  }  [ 5 ] indeed had such a plan , then , the freedom of speech { it  }  [ 5 ] \",\n"," \"We know that { the US  }  [ 1 ] , like the West , { they  }  [ 1 ] made a lot of efforts in controlling the right of speech in the international mainstream media . This reminds me of the year 1999 . During { the Kosovo war  }  [ 2 ] , { the US  }  [ 1 ] blew up { the radio station of , the former Yugoslavia  }  [ 3 ] { the former Yugoslavia  }  [ 4 ] . Uh-huh . { It  }  [ 1 ] indeed blew up { this radio station of Yugoslavia  }  [ 3 ] { Yugoslavia  }  [ 4 ] . Right . Then , later , { the Westerners themselves , including the US  }  [ 5 ] { the US  }  [ 1 ] , admitted that the reason why { it  }  [ 1 ] won { the Kosovo war  }  [ 2 ] was to a large extent that { they  }  [ 5 ] won the other party in public opinion . Uh-huh . It seems that { this incident  }  [ 6 ] will again lead to a public opinion war . Uh-huh . After { this incident  }  [ 6 ] was exposed , ah , al - Jazeera , TV station issued { a statement  }  [ 7 ] last week . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . The main idea of { the statement  }  [ 7 ] was , eh , that { al - Jazeera TV station  }  [ 3 ] has always followed the principle of impartiality , neutrality , and balance in news coverage . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . For that purpose , { it  }  [ 3 ] is now seriously investigating the news about the US plan to bomb the al - Jazeera headquarters in reported by , ah , the British newspaper , and { it  }  [ 3 ] hopes that the British government can explain this .'Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Right , it seems that { this incident  }  [ 6 ] , as { it  }  [ 6 ] develops , will have a lot of things worthy of { our  }  [ 8 ] attention . However , as { we  }  [ 8 ] are running out of time today , let 's end { our  }  [ 8 ] discussion here .

Why are there so many who want { his  }  [ 4 ] \",\n"," \"And we begin tonight with Wal - Mart a place no doubt many of you are likely to shop. When it comes to { retail Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] { Wal - Mart  }  [ 2 ] is the biggest of the big. and that makes { it  }  [ 1 ] a big target as well. { Its  }  [ 2 ] corporate policies from buying cheap to selling cheap to providing jobs for tens of thousands of people while paying rock bottom salaries are also reasons it 's a big target. In fact right now { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] is the subject of not one but two documentaries about to be released one for one against. Two stories one giant store here 's a look. You drive up all the way up to New York City on Route 80. and you 'll see { a Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] up on the hill. and then you 'll drive farther into the town. and you 'll see uh { an empty town }  [ 3 ]  Just looks like a neutron bomb hit { it }  [ 3 ]  { It  }  [ 4 ] 's an explosive documentary that alleges { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] has a take no prisoners business philosophy that is good for profits but bad for America. { They  }  [ 1 ] do n't get { it }  [ 4 ]  When we start talking about quality reliance { they  }  [ 1 ] start talking about cheap underwear. At this point there 's something I should tell you. When you do a story on a film that 's as critical of a company as this one is about { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] I want to talk to { that company Wal - Mart  }  [ 5 ] to get { their  }  [ 5 ] reaction. { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] is not willing to go on camera. But { it  }  [ 1 ] did provide us with a written statement saying quote like any company { we  }  [ 1 ] want to make sure { our  }  [ 1 ] associates customers and local community feel good about { us }  [ 1 ]  { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] makes life better for an awful lot of people by providing low prices and good jobs to those who need them. However { we  }  [ 1 ] 're the first to admit { we  }  [ 1 ] 're not perfect and have worked hard to make substantive business changes in areas where { we  }  [ 1 ] fall short. { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] I think does n't do a good enough job telling { its  }  [ 1 ] story. So who is speaking up for { Wal - Mart }  [ 1 ]  This man. But uh { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] has closed some businesses down. but { it  }  [ 1 ] 's created others. In fact - In fact { Ron Galloway  }  [ 6 ] is not only speaking up for { the retail giant }  [ 1 ]  { he  }  [ 6 ] 's also producing a documentary in { their  }  [ 1 ] defense one that depicts { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] as an ingenious business plan that is good for America. So many people have so many negative things to say about it. but what about the positive things ? While { Galloway  }  [ 6 ] { Galloway 's pro-Wal-Mart film  }  [ 7 ] introduces us to grateful employees - Somebody did it for { me  }  [ 6 ] at a time in my life when I was totally hopeless. { the anti-Wal - mart film  }  [ 7 ] points out that in two thousand one according to court documents workers made on average less than fourteen thousand dollars a year , that { Wal - Mart 's  }  [ 1 ] CEO made twenty - seven million dollars a year. { It  }  [ 7 ] also revealed that { the owners of Wal - Mart the Walton family  }  [ 8 ] { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] the Walton family has an average net worth at or near one hundred billion dollars give or take a billion here or there depending on the price of { their  }  [ 8 ] stock at the time. Now as for { the workers or associates  }  [ 9 ] { the workers or associates as they 're called by Wal - Mart  }  [ 10 ] { they  }  [ 9 ] 're called by { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] { their  }  [ 10 ] average salary is below what the government considers the federal poverty line. There were people I 'd see that did n't eat nothing. they 'd take an hour lunch and just sit there. { This young mother that I talked to in LA  }  [ 11 ] was on Medi - Cal. { she  }  [ 11 ] got on the { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] plan. { she  }  [ 11 ] saw a doctor for the first time. The { anti-Wal-Mart  }  [ 1 ] film depicts { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] as consumed with keeping wages and benefits down and unions out by flying in executives and installing cameras to monitor employees as soon as there 's a hint that workers may be organizing. { The retail giant  }  [ 1 ] gets most of { its  }  [ 1 ] merchandise from outside the United States in places like Honduras and Bangladesh where according to the film workers make as little as fifteen cents an hour and work seven days a week. but by far the largest provider of goods to { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] is { China }  [ 12 ]  How much does { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] depend on { China }  [ 12 ]  Company officials announced that in two thousand four { they  }  [ 1 ] imported more than eighteen billion dollars in goods from the People 's Republic. I think { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] is a straw man for a set of issues that a certain group of people special interests groups have to deal with in American society. Now this is important. Officials making { the anti uh Wal - Mart film  }  [ 13 ] { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] film say { the film  }  [ 13 ] is not paid for with union dues. We asked. Also { Galloway  }  [ 14 ] making { the pro-Wal-Mart film  }  [ 13 ] tells me that { he  }  [ 14 ] 's received no money and little support in fact from { Wal - Mart itself }  [ 1 ]  In fact { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] has no plans at this time to even carry { his  }  [ 14 ] video in the stores. Kyra? Well whatever { it  }  [ 1 ] does { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] always seems to be under a microscope. Why? Because a company that big that profitable is often imitated by other companies and that may well affect your benefits and your career. Take health care for example. A { Wal - Mart  }  [ 1 ] internal memo recently leaked spelled out just how far { the retail giant  }  [ 1 ] may be willing to go to keep { its  }  [ 1 ] \",\n"," \"Out in the morning rush of Washington DC like six out of ten Americans { Tim Kane  }  [ 1 ] gets health insurance through { his  }  [ 1 ] job. I think my hands are tied. I have to go through my employers. But as an economist at the conservative Heritage foundation Tim supports an idea that might put other commuters into shock. Workplace health plans can be should be and may be going away. { Americans  }  [ 2 ] should understand that { they  }  [ 2 ] would be much better off if businesses were n't providing { them  }  [ 2 ] health care if { they  }  [ 2 ] could buy it on the free market cheaply. This is controversial stuff. { Wal - Mart  }  [ 3 ] with more than one point two million American workers is being criticized right now over a leaked company memo that suggests health care costs should be better contained. Wal - Mart Watch is a new advocacy group funded in part by labor unions to keep an eye on how the economic giant is shaping American life. I think that { Wal - Mart  }  [ 3 ] today as we speak is attempting to change uh health care for the American worker to the worse. And you 're saying that affects all of { us  }  [ 4 ] whether or not { we  }  [ 4 ] work for { Wal - Mart }  [ 3 ]  When { Wal - Mart  }  [ 3 ] makes a change in the way { they  }  [ 3 ] do { their  }  [ 3 ] business um then other businesses follow. { Wal - Mart  }  [ 3 ] told { us  }  [ 4 ] in a written statement { it  }  [ 3 ] is expanding and improving { its  }  [ 3 ] health insurance program. but { it  }  [ 3 ] adds every business is asking the question how do { we  }  [ 3 ] balance the genuine desire to provide the best benefits while remaining competitive in the global economy? That 's the catch. The United States is a rarity among nations in firmly tying health insurance to jobs making it a cost of doing business. So how did it get that way? Blame it on World War Two when fear of inflation prompted President Roosevelt to freeze wages. With so many Americans going to battle businesses were frantic for workers. So { instead of more money  }  [ 5 ] { they  }  [ 5 ] offered health insurance. Healthy employees are undeniably better for business better for society. but is that { Wal - Mart  }  [ 3 ] { Wal - Mart 's  }  [ 3 ] responsibility? Look. { this  }  [ 6 ] is a private company. What business is { it  }  [ 6 ] of yours how { they  }  [ 3 ] do { their  }  [ 3 ] business? { We  }  [ 7 ] the taxpayers are paying for { Wal - Mart  }  [ 8 ] to profit. um and so therefore { we  }  [ 7 ] have a say. And you believe that gives you a say. { We  }  [ 7 ] 're stockholders. { We  }  [ 7 ] 're shareholders in the company. A study before Congress last year said { less than half of Wal - Mart employees  }  [ 9 ] { Wal - Mart  }  [ 8 ] employees were fully covered by the company insurance and that a significant number secure { their  }  [ 9 ] health care from publicly subsidized programs. George Miller from California authored that report. I do n't think that { Wal - Mart  }  [ 8 ] either has built an acceptable system for real health care for employees and { they  }  [ 8 ] have n't really provided much to the national debate on how we can accomplish this uh as a nation. The debate over how workplace health insurance might fade and what might replace it is not just about { Wal - Mart }  [ 8 ]  And { Wal - Mart 's  }  [ 8 ] \",\n"," \"And { we  }  [ 1 ] continue the theme now. { Andy Serwer  }  [ 2 ] works for { us  }  [ 1 ] here at CNN and for Fortune Magazine. { Andy  }  [ 2 ] 's one of the few journalists who 's profiled { the Walton family }  [ 3 ]  That 's why { he  }  [ 2 ] 's the perfect guest to talk about Wal - Mart. { Andy  }  [ 2 ] thanks so much for being with { us  }  [ 1 ] again. Good to see you. you know you wonder. You know { the Waltons }  [ 4 ]  At what level will this affect { them }  [ 4 ]  { They  }  [ 4 ] 're about to get hit with a whole lot of bad pub. Well you know in some senses Rick { they  }  [ 4 ] 're used to it by now. I mean this is a company that 's come under attack for really the past ten years in a big way from labor unions from people in small towns from people in big towns. But this time it 's going to be in churches. it 's going to be in small gathering places in middle America with { people  }  [ 5 ] saying some pretty horrible things - Do n't your feelings get hurt. or are { they  }  [ 5 ] at a different level if your employees come out and say I ca n't feed my kids. I 'm not making enough money. you 're not giving me enough benefits. you 're not paying me for my overtime work. Well I think { the Walton family  }  [ 3 ] does take it personally. I mean { their  }  [ 3 ] name is on the door. { Their  }  [ 3 ] father Sam Walton started this company. { They  }  [ 3 ] do n't like the bad publicity. but { they  }  [ 3 ] also feel wronged. { They  }  [ 3 ] do n't believe a lot of the charges are true. and { they  }  [ 3 ] are really starting to fight back. And we 're seeing articles describing how { they  }  [ 3 ] 've really rallied and brought tremendous efforts to bear opening up offices in Washington and state capitals. { They  }  [ 3 ] have a war room where { they  }  [ 3 ] review all the criticism. and { they  }  [ 3 ] try to respond now. But let me ask you this as I 'm sure { people at home  }  [ 6 ] are sitting there thinking right now about { their  }  [ 6 ] own job. if { Wal - Mart  }  [ 7 ] is right and { their  }  [ 7 ] model is right is this the way we 're going to go? Will { other workers  }  [ 8 ] feel like perhaps { their  }  [ 8 ] compensation packages { their  }  [ 8 ] wages are going to be perhaps either trimmed down or worse as { they  }  [ 8 ] allude to in this documentary? Well you 're talking about a race to the bottom in terms of compensation and benefits for American workers. And you 're seeing this happening at { Wal - Mart }  [ 7 ]  but you 're also seeing this happen at big manufacturing companies. Do n't forget people at Delta people at { GM people at Delphi  }  [ 9 ] are getting { their  }  [ 9 ] wages and salaries cut too and that does n't have anything to do with { Wal - Mart }  [ 7 ]  Having said that { Wal - Mart  }  [ 7 ] is the biggest employer in { the country }  [ 10 ]  so { they  }  [ 7 ] 're sort of the benchmark company the company that other companies look to like GM in the past and like a US Steel. So I think other companies are looking at what { Wal - Mart  }  [ 7 ] is doing and saying you know , what is the new wage and pay scale in { this country }  [ 10 ]  But { Wal - Mart  }  [ 7 ] is really the king of the bottom line , are n't { they }  [ 7 ]  { They  }  [ 7 ] are. { They  }  [ 7 ] really know how to make things out of nothing. and the person who 's really benefiting is the consumer who goes in there and gets a sweater for four bucks. Well and that 's what they say Rick. I mean one point three million Americans work at { Wal - Mart }  [ 7 ]  A lot of people like working there. { We  }  [ 11 ] have to remember that. I mean it 's not all these people who work there are unhappy. That 's number one. Number two the { Wal - Mart  }  [ 7 ] people say look. { we  }  [ 11 ] 're paying people one point three million Americans. but { hundreds of millions of Americans  }  [ 12 ] are benefiting from low prices. { They  }  [ 12 ] 're able to buy a VCR { they  }  [ 12 ] might not be able to buy because { we  }  [ 7 ] 're keeping { our  }  [ 7 ] costs low. That 's { their  }  [ 7 ] response. If { their  }  [ 7 ] message is right why are n't { they  }  [ 7 ] putting one of { their  }  [ 7 ] big kahunas out there to talk to { Rick Sanchez  }  [ 13 ] to talk to Andy and say look , this is all wrong? Right now { they  }  [ 7 ] 're not talking. { they  }  [ 7 ] 're not willing to go on camera. Well { they  }  [ 7 ] 're just starting to. You have to remember { this company  }  [ 7 ] was a very closed uh culture really founded by Sam Walton. { He  }  [ 13 ] passed away in nineteen ninety - two. { He  }  [ 13 ] did n't believe in talking to the press. { He  }  [ 13 ] did n't believe in PR. { He  }  [ 13 ] said all we need to do was open stores up and offer goods at low prices. { They  }  [ 7 ] 're starting to realize that { they  }  [ 7 ] need to respond more and more. So { they  }  [ 7 ] 're just getting up to speed. but I think you 're right. { They  }  [ 7 ] should get out there and tell { their  }  [ 7 ] side of the story. Is { this  }  [ 14 ] going to be a big hit for { them }  [ 7 ]  No I do n't think { it  }  [ 14 ] is going to be a big hit because there 're other things out there. You know there 's a negative documentary film about { Wal - Mart }  [ 15 ]  There 's maybe a positive film out there as well. { They  }  [ 7 ] 're going to marshal { their  }  [ 7 ] forces. and { they  }  [ 7 ] 're going to fight back. and a lot of people like to shop at { Wal - Mart }  [ 15 ]  I mean { they  }  [ 7 ] would n't be a problem to some people if { they  }  [ 7 ] \",\n"," \"Still to come on Newsnight the Big Easy suddenly split in two how people in the same city are living different lives two months after Katrina.

While { they  }  [ 6 ] came back to mold and a busted heater { their  }  [ 6 ] problems seem miniscule. One of the biggest problems we have over here truthfully is traffic. There is no traffic in other parts of town. This is the devastated Lower Ninth Ward. Restaurants gas stations closed. neighborhoods vacant filled with trash. Contrast that with Algiers where carved pumpkins dot the landscape and most of the stores even little cafes are open for business. { We  }  [ 7 ] just isolated. { We  }  [ 7 ] like on a island over here. { We  }  [ 7 ] isolated from the whole city. { Daisy Peters 's  }  [ 8 ] feelings are understandable , { her  }  [ 8 ] { her house in ruins }  [ 9 ]  Other than the help of a few family members clearing away debris { she  }  [ 8 ] 's on { her  }  [ 8 ] own.

Not a pretty picture. but { Rusty Amarante  }  [ 10 ] has seen it all before. Would you recommend that a room like { this  }  [ 11 ] be sort of torn down and start all over? I do n't think you need to tear { it  }  [ 11 ] down. I think you need to thoroughly gut { it }  [ 11 ]  You need to take out. Gutting { a house  }  [ 12 ] , stripping { it  }  [ 12 ] to the bones like a Thanksgiving turkey seems like a bitter pill for the average homeowner. but { Rusty  }  [ 10 ] has a way of putting things in perspective. Really you 're just talking about redoing the interior building envelope here. So uh as devastating as it is you 're really kind of fortunate because once you take out the plaster , once you take out the insulation make sure that the inside of the building is dry uh the foundation is dry you can really start the rebuilding process. And. But what about the structure of { the house }  [ 12 ]  Any osteoporosis in those bones? From what I can see of { the brick from the outside  }  [ 13 ] { it  }  [ 13 ] looks very solid.

I never back down never. { Stanley Tookie Williams  }  [ 1 ] co-founded the Crips street gang. { He  }  [ 1 ] robbed and murdered and was convicted of { his  }  [ 1 ] crimes in nineteen eighty - one. But from { his  }  [ 1 ] cell on death row { Williams  }  [ 1 ] spent years writing { children 's books  }  [ 7 ] and preaching against gang violence. And if { he  }  [ 1 ] { he dies  }  [ 8 ] some people are not going to have the opportunity to learn from { his  }  [ 8 ] mistakes. { Edgar Medina  }  [ 9 ] read { the books  }  [ 7 ] and says { Williams  }  [ 1 ] convinced { him  }  [ 9 ] to stay in school. If I would have been in a gang right now I would '{ ve  }  [ 9 ] probably be in jail dead. Instead { he  }  [ 1 ] 's fifteen on track to graduate and go to college. I heard one report where they say { he  }  [ 1 ] saved a hundred fifty thousand kids from joining gangs. That 's absurd. How do you know that? Retired sergeant Wes McBride worked the gang detail for twenty - six years in LA County. It 's not against { the law  }  [ 10 ] to be a gang member. It 's against { the law  }  [ 10 ] to kill people. and that 's what { he  }  [ 1 ] 's convicted of. A witness says { Williams  }  [ 1 ] robbed and executed a Seven Eleven employee then made fun of { the man  }  [ 11 ] as { he  }  [ 11 ] died. { He  }  [ 1 ] was also convicted of gunning down an entire family father mother and daughter.

To kill { Stan  }  [ 1 ] will be throwing the baby out with the bath water. { Jackson  }  [ 13 ] says executing { Williams  }  [ 1 ] sends the wrong message. You would be telling gang members or those wannabe gang members do n't care how you turn your life around. once you are stuck you are stuck.

You know and even if { he  }  [ 1 ] did does that mean uh you 're forgiven for murdering a whole family? No I do n't think so. Like { his  }  [ 1 ] life { Tookie Williams '  }  [ 1 ] \",\n"," \"Well among those who believe { Tookie Williams '  }  [ 1 ] life should be spared is Lewis Yablonsky a criminologist expert in gang behavior and author of { the book Gangsters }  [ 2 ]  { He  }  [ 1 ] joins { us  }  [ 3 ] now live. Sir let me ask you why do you think { Tookie  }  [ 1 ] should not die? Well I 've been studying gangs for fifty years. and { we  }  [ 3 ] 're always looking for solutions. Uh here 's a man who has changed { his  }  [ 1 ] lifestyle. I 've read all { his  }  [ 1 ] books. { He  }  [ 1 ] was significant in contributing some theories to { my book uh Gangsters }  [ 2 ]  and I think { he  }  [ 1 ] can be a positive force in uh turning around young gangsters. In fact there 're several programs in the California Department of uh Corrections where uh ex-offenders some lifers are working with young offenders very effectively. Uh the Amity program uh in several prisons Phoenix program in several prisons. and uh I 've seen uh the impact of lifers individuals who are what I would refer to as experienced therapists. { These  }  [ 4 ] are individuals who 've been there like { Tookie }  [ 1 ]  { They  }  [ 4 ] { They 've  }  [ 5 ] gone through a transformation as { he  }  [ 5 ] has over a period of twenty years. and { they  }  [ 4 ] can have a real impact on some of the younger offenders to not go down { their  }  [ 4 ] path and end up uh being executed. Well you know { he  }  [ 5 ] writes in { his  }  [ 5 ] memoir it was u- ha - { He  }  [ 5 ] says daily { he  }  [ 5 ] spent studying and questioning uh and soulsearching. { He  }  [ 5 ] said { he  }  [ 5 ] began to develop a sense of critical reasoning from which sprang the first stirring of +conscience. This was the moment when redemption infused itself into my life. You read this writing. and you think wow this is somebody who killed three people? Do you believe that murderers can be reformed? Is { this man  }  [ 5 ] healthy? If { he  }  [ 5 ] were to walk the streets again would { he  }  [ 5 ] never kill again? { we  }  [ 6 ] 're not talking about letting { him  }  [ 5 ] out of prison. { We  }  [ 6 ] 're talking about clemency to give { him  }  [ 5 ] life without parole where { we  }  [ 6 ] do n't kill { him }  [ 5 ]  And I have already made some uh efforts to put { him  }  [ 5 ] into a particular program where { he  }  [ 5 ] would uh be effective. One of the major gang problems uh of the insanity of gang problems is young black men killing young black men and Hispanic kids killing Hispanic kids. { He  }  [ 5 ] talks a lot about black on black crime. Tookie - Right. And { Tookie  }  [ 5 ] has come up with some interesting observations about why this goes on as - Uh they 're good enough to put in my theoretical book on gangsters. and I think { he  }  [ 5 ] could be very effective in a program. and as I 've indicated I 've already talked to the director uh of a program in the California prison system. And if { Governor Schwarzenegger  }  [ 7 ] really means what { he  }  [ 7 ] says about uh the California Department of Corrections with emphasis on corrections and rehabilitation { he  }  [ 7 ] should spare. But - { He  }  [ 7 ] 's really the only one who can do it. and as I 've - Well Lewis let me ask you. let 's say { he  }  [ 7 ] is granted clemency. what do you say to the victims ' families? Well { we  }  [ 8 ] talk about redemption. { We  }  [ 8 ] talk about forgiveness. Let 's put it this way. Uh twenty - five years ago I was a different person than I am now. I think { Tookie Williams  }  [ 9 ] from my communications with { him  }  [ 9 ] is a different person today than when we was convicted of { these crimes }  [ 10 ]  I 'm not uh excusing { the crimes }  [ 10 ]  and I 'm not necessarily uh against { the death penalty }  [ 11 ]  Uh some individuals perhaps should get { the death penalty }  [ 11 ]  but this is a man who can contribute to our society. and { he  }  [ 9 ] \",\n"," \"And { we  }  [ 1 ] talked about family members. and { Lora Owens  }  [ 2 ] is the stepmother of Albert Owens the convenience store worker that { Tookie Williams  }  [ 3 ] was convicted of killing. { She  }  [ 2 ] joins { us  }  [ 1 ] now by phone. and I appreciate your time { Lora }  [ 2 ]  I want to take a moment to talk about { Albert  }  [ 4 ] if you do n't mind and just uh remind { us  }  [ 1 ] about { his  }  [ 4 ] life. Okay. Go ahead { Lora }  [ 2 ]  Thank you for having me on. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to even speak about { Albert }  [ 4 ]  { He  }  [ 4 ] seems to be the forgotten one. Unfortunately { the Owens family  }  [ 5 ] studied gangs specifically the gang that { Williams  }  [ 3 ] had because { it  }  [ 6 ] affected { our  }  [ 7 ] life. Do you have any idea the impact that { it  }  [ 6 ] has had on { the Owens family }  [ 5 ]  See the picture of { my son }  [ 8 ]  { We  }  [ 1 ] see { him }  [ 8 ]  That 's a man that went out. { he  }  [ 8 ] wanted to make an honest living where { Williams  }  [ 3 ] goes out to take whatever { he  }  [ 3 ] wants. Now { we  }  [ 7 ] have a major impact. Life 's different now because of what { Williams  }  [ 3 ] did to { the Owens family }  [ 5 ]  Life 's a lot different. I do n't have to study gangs. I only have to study what { Williams  }  [ 3 ] did. Is death - A big difference. { Lora  }  [ 2 ] is death the answer? Does { Tookie Williams  }  [ 3 ] need to die? Is that what would make you feel better would make { your family  }  [ 5 ] feel better? { It  }  [ 9 ] 's called closure Miss Phillips. That 's what { it  }  [ 9 ] 's called because when someone like { Williams  }  [ 3 ] can do all of these things - what has { he  }  [ 3 ] paid? { He  }  [ 3 ] does n't even say { he  }  [ 3 ] 's guilty. { He  }  [ 3 ] says { he  }  [ 3 ] 's innocent. Alright so you have to do that with all of the appeals. { He  }  [ 3 ] says { he  }  [ 3 ] 's sorry. For what. that { he  }  [ 3 ] did n't get away with it? { He  }  [ 3 ] could do so much to stop gangs. { He  }  [ 3 ] - Is { he }  [ 3 ]  No { he  }  [ 3 ] does n't do any of that. What { he  }  [ 3 ] does is find somebody who 's willing to write for { him  }  [ 3 ] somebody who 's out there with the cause. { Williams  }  [ 3 ] is n't the important one in this right to life cause. It 's the fact that it is a cause. and { he  }  [ 3 ] 's got all of { these people  }  [ 10 ] behind { him }  [ 3 ]  { They  }  [ 10 ] have n't walked where { the Owens family  }  [ 11 ] has walked. { They  }  [ 10 ] have n't had to take someone who 's been murdered and try and build a life without { them }  [ 10 ]  { Lora Tookie  }  [ 12 ] has { this apology  }  [ 13 ] uh that { he  }  [ 12 ] has written that of course { he  }  [ 12 ] wants everybody to hear. Part of it says I pray that one day { my apology  }  [ 13 ] will be accepted. I also pray that your suffering caused by gang violence will soon come to an end as more { gang members  }  [ 14 ] wake up and stop hurting { themselves  }  [ 14 ] and others. I vow to spend the rest of my life working toward solutions. Does that give you any sense of peace? { He  }  [ 3 ] did n't write it to { us }  [ 15 ]  That 's not who { he  }  [ 3 ] wrote that to. { He  }  [ 3 ] wrote that to further { his  }  [ 3 ] gang connections. That 's who { he  }  [ 3 ] 's writing that to. { He  }  [ 3 ] did n't write that to { the Owens family }  [ 11 ]  Lora Owens stepmother of Albert Owens { we  }  [ 15 ] sure appreciate your time. I know this is a difficult uh period for you and { your family }  [ 11 ] \",\n"," \"Well different perspective. { We  }  [ 1 ] brought you the tale of two cities. and now { we  }  [ 1 ] bring you a tale of two families. And it 'll be interesting to see what happens. There are a lot of people protesting and a lot of people that uh want to see him die. Still ahead on { Newsnight  }  [ 2 ] winter is coming to the mountains of Pakistan. Will millions of those who survived last month 's massive earthquake now succumb to something else bitter cold? Also - The city of lights is aflame with torched cars. A frightening week of violence continues in Paris. { Newsnight  }  [ 2 ] \",\n"," \"Here 's a follow - up. High in { the Himalaya Mountains tragedy  }  [ 1 ] is ready to strike once again. First { it  }  [ 1 ] came in the form of a massive earthquake. Soon though it may be the freezing temperatures and the snow of a bitter winter that 's going to take a terrible toll. The number 's already brutal. Death toll eighty thousand by some counts and climbing. Another eight hundred thousand without shelter. not even a tent in some cases. More than two million in need of food. Many in mountain regions where relief trucks or even helicopters ca n't seem to get to. Now ITV 's Bill Neely reports. that 's just from the Kashmir region. that 's the area right between India and Pakistan. { The helicopters  }  [ 2 ] are still busy here. but the weather is worsening. There are days { they  }  [ 2 ] wo n't fly and places { they  }  [ 2 ] wo n't go. Into one of these today came Save the Children driving a convoy of two hundred tents six thousand feet up into one of Kashmir 's most remote corners. There waiting hundreds of villagers. this aid the difference between life and death. { One man  }  [ 3 ] at least has suffered enough death. Is seven kids one mom and one wife. { He  }  [ 3 ] lost { his  }  [ 3 ] { his seven children }  [ 4 ]  { Seven children }  [ 4 ]  { He  }  [ 3 ] lost { his  }  [ 3 ] seven childrens plus eh { his  }  [ 3 ] wife and eh { his  }  [ 3 ] mom. Even the blind walked for hours across a mountain to get here. The tents blankets and clothes { their  }  [ 5 ] only protection against a brutal winter. It 's a race here against time and against the heavy snows that are on { their  }  [ 5 ] way. In about two weeks time these mountains and this valley will be covered in snow. and the logic of survival then is brutally simple. Anyone without shelter will die. The problem is there are n't enough tents here or anywhere else. so { a second disaster that the UN says could kill thousands  }  [ 6 ] is n't just looming. it 's highly likely. { These children  }  [ 4 ] survived the earthquake. Twenty thousand did n't. The coming cold and hunger could carry off thousands more. So { they  }  [ 4 ] struggle away with { their  }  [ 4 ] tents. and even the aid workers who 've been through { the tsunami  }  [ 7 ] struggle to cope here. Logistically it 's the worst without a doubt. It 's getting high in mountains. The road that { we  }  [ 8 ] came up now is pretty perilous to say the least. but { we  }  [ 8 ] could get vehicles up. { We  }  [ 8 ] 're talking about a lot of places have got no vehicular access whatsoever. Then { we  }  [ 8 ] 're talking meal trains and helicopters. and { we  }  [ 8 ] 're really running out of time. It 's quite a serious situation. { the tsunami  }  [ 7 ] was much easier to deal with than this? { The tsunami  }  [ 7 ] did n't have winter coming. I mean here we 've just got this hammer blow that 's going to come down very very shortly. { The first disaster  }  [ 6 ] was an act of god. A second can be prevented by time. and aid money is running out.

That 's what Dylan the Candy Bar is. { It  }  [ 7 ] 's an homage to candy. I was inspired when I was younger by uh Charlie and { the Chocolate Factory }  [ 3 ]  And { it  }  [ 7 ] 's a bunch of stores that have a sort of entertainment philosophy. And I just thought there 's not anything like that in the candy business that you know - FAO Schwartz had { it  }  [ 8 ] with toys. or Niketown has { it  }  [ 8 ] with sneakers. I thought would n't it be fun for even me who 's a candy freak to just walk in and have this like oversized emporium of oversized lollipops. I have four stores at the moment. I 'm hoping to open a good twenty more. The flagship 's in New York City. The other Dylan 's Candy Bars are in Houston Orlando and Roosevelt Field. Well this is my office. I 've always loved candy. At first it was about the taste. I love gummy bears and gummy fish. I just always started to look at candy 's packaging. And as an art history major I also was influenced by a lot of pop artists. This is { our  }  [ 9 ] stripe which are on { our  }  [ 9 ] bags and { our  }  [ 9 ] logos. I really loved art and candy. Did you like the ones that { we  }  [ 9 ] were talking about for the malls though? { Our  }  [ 9 ] theme is to basically merge pop culture art fashion with candy and also to have like the largest assortment of colors and flavors. { This  }  [ 10 ] is { our  }  [ 9 ] body uh shake. { It  }  [ 10 ] 's a milk bubble bath chocolate. { We  }  [ 9 ] do n't just carry candy per se to eat. { We  }  [ 9 ] have a spa product like chocolate bath powders and vanilla body moisturizers. { We  }  [ 9 ] 're expanding into um { our  }  [ 9 ] own Dylan 's Candy Bars spa line. { Our  }  [ 9 ] customer is really the kid in the adult.  and it 's anyone.

Bitter experience has taught { us  }  [ 1 ] that. Here 's CNN 's Heidi Collins. Columbine Springfield Pearl Red Lake Minnesota this past March and now Jacksboro Tennessee. It is a list that conjures up images of screaming children injured victims and gun - wielding kids. Different towns with tragically similar stories. What makes these young men snap. and what qualities if any do school shooters share? According to the FBI there are dozens of risk factors when it comes to school violence. but there is no one definitive profile of this type of criminal. Most often the perpetrator is a white male age eleven to eighteen who was described as feeling picked on or bullied by his peers. { We  }  [ 1 ] allow { boys  }  [ 2 ] to be angry and aggressive. but { we  }  [ 1 ] do n't allow { them  }  [ 2 ] to express fear and sadness and other more vulnerable emotions. so hence when { they  }  [ 2 ] get rejected or { they  }  [ 2 ] get disappointed { they  }  [ 2 ] have a harder time dealing with that. and it often comes out in anger. Most of the shooters like you see in this video of { Dylan Clebold  }  [ 3 ] and { Eric Harris  }  [ 4 ] from Columbine High School had a fascination with firearms or violent video games. And while there were signs or warnings about { their  }  [ 5 ] intentions { they  }  [ 5 ] were not taken seriously at the time. { The sheriff 's department  }  [ 6 ] did n't respond to { our  }  [ 7 ] um reported threats by { Eric Harris  }  [ 4 ] against { our  }  [ 7 ] son for thirteen months. Columbine would not have happened if { they  }  [ 6 ] had investigated that to begin with. Classmates say { Clebold  }  [ 3 ] and { Harris  }  [ 4 ] who brought terror to Littleton Colorado in nineteen ninety - eight and Jeff Weiss the Red Lake Minnesota teen who killed nine people and wounded seven before fatally shooting himself all wore dark trenchcoats and were fans of { Marilyn Manson }  [ 8 ]  Kip Kinkel who killed two students in Springfield Oregon was a fan of { Manson  }  [ 8 ] 's music as well. According to the FBI { all of the shooters  }  [ 9 ] may have felt the desire to defend narcissitic views of { themselves  }  [ 9 ] and had very low self - esteem. Luke Woodham killed two students in Pearl Mississippi. Well I guess you all start remembering me now. I 'm probably going to get pretty famous.

Well Anderson { the democrats  }  [ 5 ] are celebrating in the two biggest races { tonight }  [ 1 ]  Those are the races for the governorships in { Virginia  }  [ 6 ] and { New Jersey }  [ 7 ]  { CNN  }  [ 3 ] projecting that { Tim Kaine  }  [ 8 ] currently the lieutenant governor will be the next governor of { the state of Virginia }  [ 9 ] { Virginia }  [ 6 ]  { Tim Kaine  }  [ 8 ] a democrat winning in { Virginia  }  [ 6 ] a state { President Bush  }  [ 10 ] carried a year ago. And in { New Jersey  }  [ 7 ] another democratic victory. John Corzine currently a member of the United States Senate will be { the next governor of New Jersey  }  [ 11 ] { New Jersey  }  [ 7 ] according to { CNN  }  [ 3 ] projections. One republican victory { tonight }  [ 1 ]  That is in { New York City }  [ 12 ]  Mayor Michael Bloomberg the Associated Press projects will be re-elected as the mayor of { New York City }  [ 12 ]  A democrat turned republican. so that a frustrating race for { the democrats }  [ 5 ]  but democrats will celebrate those two state - wide victories { Virginia  }  [ 6 ] of course the most significant. { President Bush  }  [ 10 ] carried { that state  }  [ 9 ] a year ago. { He  }  [ 10 ] campaigned for the republican candidate just last night an election eve appearance. Democrats will certainly make the case that { the president  }  [ 10 ] 's troubles are continuing in { the state of Virginia }  [ 9 ]  I will say though Anderson I think the bigger national question out of { the state of Virginia  }  [ 9 ] { Virginia  }  [ 9 ] might be that this helps { the current incumbant governor Mark Warner }  [ 11 ]  { He  }  [ 11 ] is leaving office and thinking about running for president. { His  }  [ 11 ] party 's strength there tonight will only encourage that. Jeff any surprises to you? No uh the most startling thing which we do n't often talk about is the sheer amount of money that these people have. { Mike Bloomberg  }  [ 13 ] is a five billion dollar man who threw seventy million dollars into this campaign. There were ads in Cantonese and Russian. { He  }  [ 13 ] won a landslide. I 'll cross the river. John Corzine 's worth about three hundred million defeated Doug Forrester a piker only worth about fifty million dollars though it was a combined campaign of about fifty million dollars. { Mark Warner  }  [ 14 ] { Mark Warner who John King just talked  }  [ 15 ] about has a personal wealth of two hundred million. and later tonight when we go to California the gentleman named Schwartzeneggar who has about a hundred million dollars threw millions into { his  }  [ 15 ] big successful effort at governor. But can { the democrats  }  [ 16 ] really crow about what 's going on in { Virginia  }  [ 17 ] and what 's going in New Jersey? Well { they  }  [ 16 ] will. um and { they  }  [ 16 ] won uh and in { Virginia  }  [ 17 ] particularly. { Virginia  }  [ 17 ] was one of the first southern states to go republican. I think Nixon carried { it  }  [ 17 ] in nineteen sixty. It is significant when a democrat succeeds a democrat not just because { it  }  [ 17 ] gives { Mark Warner  }  [ 14 ] talking points but { it  }  [ 17 ] is a crimson red state. Do { we  }  [ 18 ] want to make too much of { it }  [ 17 ]  No { we  }  [ 18 ] do n't. John King uh Arnold Schwartzeneggar 's not on the ballot. but eh some of { his  }  [ 15 ] critics say { he  }  [ 15 ] really with some of these ballot initiatives. Uh when do { the polls  }  [ 19 ] close there? { The polls  }  [ 19 ] close eleven o'clock eastern out in { California }  [ 20 ]  and to follow up on the point { Jeff  }  [ 21 ] just made about perhaps not overstating the impact for the president I think one of the things we will watch closely tonight is that some of { the polls  }  [ 19 ] are showing that the American people are a bit testy shall we say um not patient anymore with all of the politicians. And that of course would affect { the republicans  }  [ 22 ] more because { they  }  [ 22 ] are in power in Washington controlling the presidency and the Congress. Whether { they  }  [ 22 ] take it out on Governor Schwartzeneggar in { California  }  [ 20 ] could be another test of that as well. { Jeff }  [ 21 ]  One quick point. the election that mattered for { next year  }  [ 23 ] has already happened that special election in the Ohio congressional district with Cincinatti a republican district. Former Iraqi war combat veteran I guess he is a present veteran Paul Hackett came within four points of beating the republican in a district that no democrat has come close to carrying. That 's the one that 's giving { the republicans  }  [ 22 ] willies for { next year }  [ 23 ]  { All right Jeff  }  [ 21 ] { Jeff  }  [ 21 ] \",\n"," \"Still ahead on { Three Sixty  }  [ 1 ] { a family  }  [ 2 ] torn apart on whether to let { their  }  [ 2 ] { their son  }  [ 3 ] die. A case that may be heading where Terri Schiavo 's did. A fifteen year old boy at the center of it all. And in a corner of { the world where genocide claimed  }  [ 4 ] nearly a million lives a new struggle between man and beast. Around { the world  }  [ 4 ] and across America this is { Three Sixty }  [ 1 ]  In a moment a life and death struggle over a fifteen year old boy who is in a coma uh who is lying breathing on a ventilator. The fight is between { two parents who are divorced over what to do about their son }  [ 5 ] { their son }  [ 3 ] { their  }  [ 5 ] \",\n"," \"But first a check of the day 's headlines. Here 's CNN 's Erica Hill in Atlanta. Hey Erica. Hey Anderson we begin tonight in Jacksboro Tennessee where police say a student opened fire on a principal and { two assistant principals in an office in a high school }  [ 1 ]  One of { the assistant principals  }  [ 1 ] was killed , another critically wounded. In { Iraq  }  [ 2 ] the foreign military occupation of { that country  }  [ 2 ] is authorized at least through December of two thousand six. That 's because today the UN Security Council voted to extend the mandate that allows some one hundred fifty - seven thousand US troops twenty - two thousand troops from other countries to operate there. The Iraq provisional government requested the extension. In Australia supporters of alleged terror suspect with TV reporters shouting stay away. { Australian authorities  }  [ 3 ] say { they  }  [ 3 ] prevented a terrorist attack through { their  }  [ 3 ] undercover work. Seventeen people were arrested. { Officials  }  [ 4 ] said { they  }  [ 4 ] moved in because the alleged plot had passed the planning stage. Meantime a very different crowd reaction in Salem Oregon where { two couples in - laws who invested forty dollars in lottery tickets  }  [ 5 ] had { their  }  [ 5 ] claim certified today in the second biggest payout in US lottery history. Three hundred forty million smackers. Talk about a little bit uh of love to share around the family there. But Anderson sounds like { they  }  [ 6 ] 're going to lead a very normal life. { They  }  [ 6 ] 're saying may not even get that many more presents under the tree this Christmas. Wow man I hope so. You know hear all these horror stories about how people react. and let 's just hope { they  }  [ 6 ] sock { it  }  [ 7 ] away and save { it  }  [ 7 ] up for { their  }  [ 6 ] kids or something. I know. { Erica  }  [ 8 ] thanks. We 'll check in with { you  }  [ 8 ] \",\n"," \"You know it 's hard to think of a more agonizing decision that a parent could face choosing whether to let a child die or to hold out hope no matter what the doctors and all the other experts say. Usually { these horrible decisions  }  [ 1 ] are made in private. sometimes unfortunately { they  }  [ 1 ] divide an entire country. { The sad case of Terri Schiavo  }  [ 2 ] { Terri Schiavo  }  [ 3 ] not only tore { her  }  [ 3 ] family apart. { it  }  [ 2 ] really re-ignited a debate as thorny as { it  }  [ 2 ] is heartbreaking. { The case of Jansen Jones  }  [ 2 ] { Jansen Jones  }  [ 4 ] is just as complicated and equally heartbreaking. CNN 's Rick Sanchez from Bountiful Utah with more.  Rick? Yeah thanks so much Anderson. This is the new facility where uh { Jansen Jones  }  [ 4 ] is going to be staying from now on. { His  }  [ 4 ] father decided that { he  }  [ 4 ] should be here. Uh this is what we know about { his case }  [ 2 ] { his  }  [ 4 ] case. { He  }  [ 4 ] was probably unable to breathe accoding to { his  }  [ 4 ] parents and experts who have talked to { him  }  [ 4 ] for about twenty minutes. Now { we  }  [ 5 ] 've talked to medical experts about this situation. and they tell { us  }  [ 5 ] if a fifteen year old goes without oxygen for fifteen to twenty minutes , what results is usually severe and irreparable brain damage. Here now is Jansen 's story. You 're not supposed to have a heart attack when you 're only fifteen years old. I 'll never forget the morning that uh I got { the news }  [ 6 ]  { The news  }  [ 6 ] was grim. { Margaret  }  [ 7 ] 's little boy with the likeable smile and the dimple cheeks had experienced full cardiac arrest. What 's worse it happened on this dark street corner one morning while riding { his  }  [ 4 ] { his bike  }  [ 8 ] to school. { He  }  [ 4 ] was all alone { no mom  }  [ 9 ] no dad no help until finally { he  }  [ 4 ] was spotted by a paramedic on { her  }  [ 9 ] way to work. When { we  }  [ 5 ] found { him  }  [ 4 ] { he  }  [ 4 ] was um still on { his  }  [ 4 ] { his bike }  [ 8 ]  um and { his  }  [ 4 ] head was um against cement. { Jansen Jones  }  [ 4 ] was rushed by helicopter to the hospital. Did you think { he  }  [ 4 ] would be able to pull through? I had faith. But then doctors showed { Margaret  }  [ 7 ] { her  }  [ 7 ] { her son  }  [ 10 ] 's MRI test and explained to { her  }  [ 7 ] what results when the brain is deprived of oxygen. Does { he  }  [ 4 ] blink? No. Does { he  }  [ 4 ] make any sounds? No. Nothing. Nothing. Are you convinced that { he  }  [ 4 ] is in fact brain - dead? Yes I am. { Margaret  }  [ 7 ] made { a decision  }  [ 11 ] after talking to hospital officials here at the University of Utah that { she  }  [ 7 ] would take { her  }  [ 7 ] { her son  }  [ 10 ] off of life support. { She  }  [ 7 ] made { the decision  }  [ 11 ] though not based solely on science or even { her  }  [ 7 ] own observations. { She  }  [ 7 ] tells { us  }  [ 5 ] { she  }  [ 7 ] made { the decision based on her Christianity her faith }  [ 11 ] { her  }  [ 7 ] Christianity { her  }  [ 7 ] faith. And you do n't think that { God  }  [ 12 ] would want you to have { your son  }  [ 10 ] continue in the condition { he  }  [ 10 ] 's in now? No. You 're convinced of that. Yes. But { God  }  [ 12 ] is also the reason { Margaret  }  [ 7 ] { Margaret 's ex-husband Jansen 's father  }  [ 13 ] gives for { his  }  [ 13 ] decision to keep the boy on life support. { He  }  [ 13 ] needs to be given a chance to live. Also { a devout Christian John Jones  }  [ 14 ] has little faith in what doctors tell { him }  [ 14 ]  Doctors have been wrong before and misdiagnosed.  I do n't agree with { him  }  [ 14 ] at all. In fact when asked you think letting { him  }  [ 14 ] go is the Christian thing to do , { She  }  [ 7 ] says- Yes I think so. While { he  }  [ 14 ] says - I believe in a living God. and I believe that uh you can still perform { miracles  }  [ 15 ] as you want to call { them }  [ 15 ]  Two parents one God and one life or death decision that may end up being settled in a court of law. { Rick  }  [ 14 ] how could this wind up in the courts? Well here in { the state of Utah  }  [ 16 ] because { the father  }  [ 13 ] had custody of the child they 've been divorced now for uh three years { he  }  [ 13 ] would be able to make { the decision }  [ 17 ]  However if { the mother  }  [ 18 ] decides that { she  }  [ 18 ] wants to take { him  }  [ 13 ] to court to see if { her decision  }  [ 17 ] { her  }  [ 18 ] decision is allowed all the folks in { this uh state  }  [ 16 ] that I have talked to who 've dealt with matters like this in the past say that judges usually allow the evidence to be heard from both sides. That would mean Anderson what you would have is another court battle as you alluded to earlier similar to the { Schiavo  }  [ 19 ] case. All right Rick Sanchez in Bountiful. Thanks very much { Rick }  [ 14 ]  You know it 's been more than seven months now since { Terri Schiavo 's  }  [ 19 ] life came to an end. { She  }  [ 19 ] died March thirty - first thirteen days after { her  }  [ 19 ] feeding tube was removed. Up to that point we got to know { Schiavo 's parents and her husband  }  [ 20 ] { her  }  [ 19 ] { her husband  }  [ 21 ] fairly well as { their  }  [ 20 ] fight played out all too publicly on television. Since { Terri  }  [ 22 ] 's death { they  }  [ 20 ] have n't been seen much on the national stage. but { their  }  [ 20 ] battles go on. Tonight in a new segment { we  }  [ 23 ] 're calling Memory Lapse { we  }  [ 23 ] take a look at what the family is doing right now. { Teri 's husband Michael  }  [ 21 ] is back in the news making a splash in politics far from home by endorsing the candidacy of democrat Tim Kaine for governor of Virginia in tonight 's election. { Michael Schiavo  }  [ 21 ] spoke out against politicians intervening in family affairs. { He  }  [ 21 ] 's also been busy writing about { his  }  [ 21 ] side of the battle over { his  }  [ 21 ] wife. { He  }  [ 21 ] and author Michael Hirsch are colloborating on { a book titled Terri the Truth }  [ 24 ]  It 's scheduled to be released in March. and that will once again put { him  }  [ 21 ] at odds with { Terri  }  [ 22 ] 's parents whose still untitled memoir will be released that same month. { The Schindlers ' book  }  [ 24 ] { The Schindlers '  }  [ 25 ] book will share { their  }  [ 24 ] struggle to keep { Terri  }  [ 22 ] alive a story { they  }  [ 24 ] 've been through speeches and public statements.

Genocide though the US refused to call it that at first. { Eight hundred thousand people at least women men and children  }  [ 1 ] were brutally killed hacked to death stabbed thrown into rivers. Today { the genocide  }  [ 2 ] 's effects are still haunting both { the survivors and the wildlife in Rwanda }  [ 3 ] { the wildlife in Rwanda }  [ 4 ] { Rwanda }  [ 5 ]  You see many of those who fled some of { them  }  [ 3 ] settled in an animal refuge. Renown wildlife advocate Jack Hannah director of the Columbus Zoo recently went to { Rwanda  }  [ 5 ] to see how { the people and animals  }  [ 1 ] are co-existing. { Rwanda  }  [ 5 ] { Rwanda this breathtakingly beautiful land  }  [ 6 ] is soaked in blood the people living with the pain of { their  }  [ 6 ] history. { Akagera National Park  }  [ 7 ] once a spectacular wildlife refuge is now a refuge to many Rwandans who survived { the genocide  }  [ 2 ] and returned to their native land trying to start life anew. There are { so many people in Rwanda  }  [ 8 ] { Rwanda  }  [ 5 ] now { they  }  [ 8 ] 've taken over two - thirds of { the national park }  [ 7 ]  And because of that { Rwanda  }  [ 5 ] now faces a problem. What will happen to { the wildlife }  [ 4 ]  How will the animals co-exist with humans? That 's what { Jack Hannah the renown wildlife advocate  }  [ 9 ] wanted to find out as { he  }  [ 9 ] went in search of wild elephants. There 's said to be eighty elephants in Akagera. but for { Hannah  }  [ 9 ] and { his  }  [ 9 ] crew finding even one was not unlike looking for that proverbial needle in a haystack. Now the elephant 's back that way , right? { Hannah  }  [ 9 ] hired a boat to take { him  }  [ 9 ] to a fishing village where there had been reports of a male elephant. They search for hours and hours. and finally - Oh yeah I see it. But even a wildlife expert like { Hannah  }  [ 9 ] was surprised to find such a mighty creature submerged in lake water. It was very unusual behavior. Look at that. { he  }  [ 9 ] 's like a submarine. { he  }  [ 9 ] 's going to use { his  }  [ 9 ] { his trunk  }  [ 10 ] . Whoa look at that. look at { him  }  [ 9 ] move tha - { He  }  [ 9 ] is going fast. That is fast. { Big elephant }  [ 11 ]  An estimated eleven feet tall , weighing perhaps fourteen thousand pounds { the mature bull elephant  }  [ 11 ] was as big and angry as any { they }  [ 12 ] d 'd seen before. And { he  }  [ 9 ] started to pursue { them }  [ 12 ]  That is fast. Remember { elephants  }  [ 13 ] can swim everybody. And { they  }  [ 13 ] got like a periscope. I do n't know if { he  }  [ 9 ] 's walking or swimming. but { he  }  [ 9 ] 's moving. { Hannah  }  [ 9 ] and { his  }  [ 9 ] crew beat it to shore and to safety not realizing that in April the US embassy in Kigali had issued a warning to American tourists about a rogue elephant charging visitors. { your trunk  }  [ 10 ] go like this. On shore { Hannah  }  [ 9 ] was greeted by local kids. Trunk. that 's it . that 's it. And in exchange for { his  }  [ 9 ] kindness { they  }  [ 14 ] shared a little known secret about { the rogue elephant }  [ 11 ]  Turns out this monster of the deep was in fact { an old friend of the children 's.  }  [ 15 ] and to prove it { they  }  [ 14 ] lured { him  }  [ 15 ] in with sweet words and sweet potatoes. Thank you so much. thank you. thank you. that 's something else. That 's all I can tell you. { Akagera National Park  }  [ 16 ] may not be all that { it  }  [ 16 ] once was. nor of course is Rwanda. but { Jack Hannah  }  [ 9 ] \",\n"," \"Had you ever seen behavior like that in elephants? No not in a while. Uh when I saw { the kids  }  [ 1 ] doing it I went up there. and I said I ca n't believe this big bull elephant a wild bull elephant. But { the kids  }  [ 1 ] had you know - animals know people. and { he  }  [ 2 ] knew no harm in that village. and { they  }  [ 1 ] actually were taking care of it. and of course when { he  }  [ 2 ] went in the musk I guess { he  }  [ 2 ] tipped over a jeep or two and you got to be careful when that happens. { We  }  [ 3 ] 're going to take a quick break. and then { we  }  [ 3 ] 'll be back with uh { Jack Hannah }  [ 4 ]  A lot more uh coming up tonight on { Three Sixty }  [ 3 ]  Stay with { us }  [ 3 ]  Before the break { we  }  [ 3 ] went to Africa with { renown wildlife advocate Jack Hannah director of the Columbus Zoo }  [ 5 ] { Jack Hannah  }  [ 4 ] director of the Columbus Zoo. { He  }  [ 5 ] took { us  }  [ 3 ] to a region of { Rwanda  }  [ 6 ] where those who survived the genocide of eleven years ago or ten and a half years ago are living side by side with wildlife. { We  }  [ 3 ] showed you the huge elephant { he  }  [ 5 ] encountered. and that was n't all { he  }  [ 5 ] saw. { Jack Hannah  }  [ 4 ] joins me now once again to show { us  }  [ 3 ] exclusive footage of { the mountain gorillas he visited }  [ 7 ] { he  }  [ 4 ] visited.

At least for me. Yeah not just the viewing. it 's the experience Anderson of being there. It 's just { people  }  [ 8 ] do n't realize { they  }  [ 8 ] can all do it as well. Uh this last year in tourism increased sixty - seven percent in { Rwanda }  [ 6 ] \",\n"," \"And I mean some of the footage that we 're showing now is footage that you shot. and it 's incredible.

Exactly right. Right there. one hour. and of course you 're not allowed to approach { them }  [ 3 ]  { they  }  [ 3 ] approach you. and that 's what you see here. these animals uh uh approach you. Now this is one actually that was uh uh taken uh out of { the wild  }  [ 4 ] and brought to a veteranarian 's place right there below uh you know where the gorillas are. That 's { a lowland gorilla  }  [ 5 ] is what you 're seeing there uh one that was brought - and of course we just ca n't put { it  }  [ 5 ] back out in { the wild  }  [ 4 ] yet. Uh the mountain gorilla as you know are the ones with the much longer hair live up about eight thousand feet. It 's where you went to visit. Yeah I went there on vacation this summer. and it 's just incredible. There { they  }  [ 6 ] are right there. { They  }  [ 6 ] 're climbing all around you. { they  }  [ 6 ] literally brush by you at times. What are the similarities to humans? I mean everyone always says how you know much like humans { they  }  [ 6 ] appear. Well well the similarities are it 's a family structure. and you watch the four and three and four years old play with { the little uh eight to ten week old babies  }  [ 7 ] you know when { their  }  [ 7 ] mother might let { them  }  [ 7 ] go away just a little bit. Right. and you see the proctection. { they  }  [ 7 ] 're not a King Kong type of animal. And the neat thing about it is there will be a web camera up there. Uh John Dick has got { the tower  }  [ 8 ] up there so people can click on { it  }  [ 8 ] within a year from now and watch { the gorillas in the wild }  [ 9 ]  No kidding really? Be unbelieveable.

Well uh uh a lot of { the refugees  }  [ 13 ] came back in. Some of { them  }  [ 13 ] got into the parks. but now what { he  }  [ 12 ] 's done , { he  }  [ 12 ] 's protected those parks where no one absolutely nobody 's allowed to go inside the park boundaries now. Uh { the gorillas  }  [ 9 ] are coming back seventeen percent. tourism is up. as I said Lake Akagera National Park is incredible. { they  }  [ 9 ] even now have the habituation of chimpanzees.

Exactly. Because eh { they  }  [ 7 ] do n't want { those divisions }  [ 8 ]  No { they  }  [ 7 ] do n't want { those divisions }  [ 8 ]  and yet they all live together. and you would think that { they  }  [ 7 ] would have { that division }  [ 9 ]  but you sure do n't have { it }  [ 9 ]  you have a tremendous love there. and by the way it 's probably now the cleanest country I 've ever seen in Africa. I could not believe what I s- And the road system is incredibile. { they  }  [ 7 ] 're good. what 's amazing too is you go to see { the gorillas  }  [ 10 ] and you start talking to the guides who are taking you up and you ask { them  }  [ 7 ] did you lose anyone and { they  }  [ 7 ] will just turn and without blinking an eye tell you you know { all my family  }  [ 11 ] is gone. Yeah { we  }  [ 12 ] had { a guide  }  [ 13 ] do the same exact thing. and { we  }  [ 12 ] said where 's { your family }  [ 11 ]  and { he  }  [ 13 ] said I lost my dad and then goes right along and talks to { his  }  [ 13 ] buddy who might be a Hutu or a Tutsi. and so- but { they  }  [ 7 ] never ever mention that uh whatsoever. But I think it 's the greatest turnaround of any country in the world in the last eh ten years. And { the gorillas  }  [ 10 ] are coming back , are n't { they  }  [ 10 ] ? I mean { they  }  [ 10 ] 're /- Oh yeah seventeen percent increase. and of course { Rwanda  }  [ 14 ] has about three hundred and seventy , right. { Uganda  }  [ 15 ] has about another three hundred. So you 're talking about a species that is very very vital as far as { their  }  [ 15 ] numbers are concerned. You know if somebody got a cold up there like the veterinary project 's doing a great job up there right now uh you would have a disaster up there. so that 's why { people  }  [ 16 ] ca n't have colds if { they  }  [ 16 ] go up and visit the gorillas that type of thing.

At this moment a fatal school shooting in uh Jacksboro Tennessee leaves an assistant principal dead. No students were injured. Authorities are holding a fifteen year old in the attack. The school 's principal and a second assistant principal are hospitalized with serious wounds. Another { CIA  }  [ 1 ] leak probe may be in the works. This time the question is who told The Washington Post that { the CIA  }  [ 1 ] is operating prisons in Eastern Europe. Republican congressional leaders have asked for an investigation. To Baghdad now. another defense attorney in { Saddam Hussein 's trial  }  [ 2 ] is murdered. A second co-defendant 's lawyer was gunned down. The killings are raising questions about whether { the trial  }  [ 2 ] will resume as scheduled on November twenty - eighth. { Indiana  }  [ 3 ] now. the mobile home park residents who survived Sunday 's deadly tornado will be allowed back to the area tomorrow. Authorities put the official death count at 22 people in two { Indiana  }  [ 3 ] \",\n"," \"Back to Jacksboro Tennessee now where tonight Campbell County Comprehensive High School is a crime scene the site of { today 's deadly school shooting }  [ 1 ]  { CNN 's David Mattingly  }  [ 2 ] joins { us  }  [ 3 ] with the latest on { the investigation }  [ 4 ]  { David }  [ 2 ]  Anderson some new information for { you  }  [ 2 ] at { this hour }  [ 5 ]  { We  }  [ 3 ] 're hearing from Knoxville the principal Gary Seal and assistant principal Jim Pierce are { both  }  [ 6 ] out of surgery at { this hour }  [ 5 ]  { Both of them  }  [ 6 ] { them  }  [ 6 ] are now listed in serious condition. { These  }  [ 6 ] are the two survivors of { this shooting }  [ 1 ]  A third assistant principal Ken Bruce was killed as { a fifteen year old student  }  [ 7 ] opened fire with a handgun near the school offices. That happened a little after two o'clock today. and as you might be able to see behind { me  }  [ 2 ] with all the flashing blue lights { the investigation  }  [ 4 ] still underway. { We  }  [ 3 ] have also learned that at { this hour  }  [ 5 ] investigators have questioned others as to where { this young man  }  [ 7 ] was able to get { a gun  }  [ 8 ] and how { he  }  [ 7 ] was able to get { it  }  [ 8 ] into the school questioning others to find out if others might have been somehow connected to this case. But at this point most of { the investigation  }  [ 4 ] is going on inside the building collecting every possible piece of evidence that they can. { The suspect  }  [ 7 ] is in custody at a juvenile detention facility. { He  }  [ 7 ] was taken there after being treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to { his  }  [ 7 ] hand. { Investigators  }  [ 9 ] are being very careful about how { they  }  [ 9 ] say uh this all came about. Uh { they  }  [ 9 ] 're not willing at this point to put any sort of A B and C sequence together. Uh there are some people who knew { this young man who say that he was troubled }  [ 7 ] { he  }  [ 10 ] was troubled. but authorities will not confirm what was going through { his  }  [ 10 ] mind or what was happening as this shooting occurred. Anderson? { David  }  [ 11 ] we 've spoke uh in the last hour to a young man who knows uh this young man who 's now in custody who said that he had been suspended previously for a year for stabbing an assitant principal with a pen or a pencil. Do you know anything more about that? Uh { authorities  }  [ 12 ] will not talk about that tonight. Uh { we  }  [ 13 ] 're hoping that { they  }  [ 12 ] will shed more light on that tomorrow. but { we  }  [ 13 ] are hearing that story from multiple students. { We  }  [ 13 ] 're not sure if it 's all part of the rumors that go around after these type of incidents do occur. but there seems to be some certain credibility in the widespread belief that uh { this student  }  [ 14 ] did have problems the year prior and had problems uh as { he  }  [ 14 ] came back to { this high school }  [ 15 ]  And { David  }  [ 11 ] we 're looking at { pictures  }  [ 16 ] now of the suspect being put into a police car. I do n't know if you 've seen { the pictures }  [ 16 ]  Is that blood on { his  }  [ 14 ] { his shirt }  [ 17 ]  That is blood on { his  }  [ 14 ] { his shirt }  [ 17 ]  Again { he  }  [ 14 ] was treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to { his  }  [ 14 ] hand suggesting that { he  }  [ 14 ] might have been wounded { himself  }  [ 14 ] during whatever struggle that occurred after these shootings. Authorities tell { us  }  [ 13 ] that { he  }  [ 14 ] had been subdued by the time the first responders arrived here so that { he  }  [ 14 ] was subdued by staff here at { the school }  [ 15 ]  After all that happened { the school  }  [ 15 ] was in lockdown. { the students  }  [ 18 ] were locked in { their  }  [ 18 ] classes for about two hours. { They  }  [ 18 ] were released uh to some very anxious parents here outside the school grounds. { The school  }  [ 15 ] is going to be closed for the rest of the week Anderson .There will be counseling here going on for anyone who needs it. and that goes for not just the students but the staff here as well. All right { David  }  [ 19 ] thanks good reporting. As { David  }  [ 19 ] \",\n"," \"Uh if we had to pick a single thing to underscore how completely life has changed in this country since nine eleven it might be the fact that there are now arguments serious ones not only against but also for torture. Never was a debate about this subject before. now there certainly is. { CNN  }  [ 1 ] 's Tom Forman has been investigating. If you could save the life of a soldier rescue the hostage children stop the next terrorist bomb by torturing a prisoner for information would you do it ? I 'd stick a knife in somebody 's thigh in a heartbeat. { Retired general Spider Marks  }  [ 2 ] a { CNN  }  [ 1 ] consultant worked for US army intelligence teaching interrogation techniques. { The kind of enemies we 're fighting  }  [ 3 ] { we  }  [ 4 ] 're fighting have no sense of right or wrong. { They  }  [ 3 ] will go to any depths to achieve { their  }  [ 3 ] ends. Do { we  }  [ 4 ] have to go with { them }  [ 3 ]  { we  }  [ 4 ] do n't need to go with { them }  [ 3 ]  { we  }  [ 4 ] need to preclude { them  }  [ 3 ] from going there. And that might include { some use of torture  }  [ 5 ] in order to prevent { it }  [ 5 ]  Polls have shown that more than sixty percent of Americans think it can sometimes be justified. But here 's the catch. Experts including { General Marks  }  [ 2 ] are convinced with the vast majority of prisoners { it  }  [ 6 ] just does n't work. { It  }  [ 6 ] does not give you credible accurate timely inactionable intelligence. Mark Jacobson a former defense department official outlines the troubles. You need to know { a prisoner  }  [ 7 ] has critical information. { the prisoner  }  [ 7 ] must be succeptable to torture. and oh by the way when people are tortured , when { people  }  [ 8 ] endure physical pain { they  }  [ 8 ] 're going to seek to stop that as quickly as possible. If I torture you you 're going to tell me exactly what I expect to hear. The White House under fire over reports of secret CIA prisons overseas says torture is not allowed. But - { We  }  [ 9 ] are going to do what is necessary to protect the American people. { We  }  [ 9 ] are also going to do so in a way that adheres to { our  }  [ 9 ] laws and to { our  }  [ 9 ] values. Uh { we  }  [ 9 ] have made that very clear. The definition of torture is infliction of severe physical pain as a means of punishment or coersion. Legal authorities around the world are arguing over what that means. Some insist the abuses at that Iraqi prison easily qualify along with sleep deprivation humiliation extreme fear. Others say those things do n't even come close. The global jury is still out. and even experts are pondering a paradox. So in your experience and in your view torture as a policy should be against { the law }  [ 10 ]  True. And yet we might still have to use { it }  [ 10 ] \",\n"," \"Well it 's interesting { President Bush  }  [ 1 ] has said categorically { we  }  [ 2 ] do n't torture. { He  }  [ 1 ] also says { we  }  [ 2 ] 'll do whatever is necessary. So what exactly does that mean? { We  }  [ 2 ] asked a couple law professors earlier this evening to discuss the issue with { us }  [ 2 ]  { John Yoo of University of California Berkeley who served in the justice department from two thousand and one to two thousand and three }  [ 3 ]  { He  }  [ 3 ] 's also a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Also joining us Alan Dershowitz professor of law at Harvard the author of a great many books including The Case for Peace How the Arab Israeli Conflict can be Resolved. Also involved in discussion was { Bill Goodman at the Center for Contitutional Rights }  [ 4 ]  Here 's some of the conversation. Professor Dershowitz under what circumstances do you think torture is justified? Torture is never justified. and I hope { we  }  [ 2 ] never have to use { it  }  [ 5 ] in { the United States }  [ 6 ]  But if { we  }  [ 2 ] ever had a ticking bomb terrorist who could under torture reveal the location of a bomb that would destroy hundreds of thousands of people I guarantee you { we  }  [ 2 ] would use { it }  [ 5 ]  That 's an empirical judgement not a normative one. And if { we  }  [ 2 ] would use { it  }  [ 5 ] then { we  }  [ 2 ] have to use { it  }  [ 5 ] only with accountability. And that means that the president of { the United States  }  [ 6 ] or the vice president or the secretary of defense or the chief justice has to specifically authorize precisely the kind of extreme measures that are permitted to be used. No extreme measures without accountability that has to be the rule. { Bill Goodman  }  [ 4 ] you believe that 's uh a slippery slope. I think it 's a very slippery slope. I think once you start to say well under these circumstances empirically you 're going to and you have to provide these kinds of measures if you do it then you 're basically that under certain circumstances { it  }  [ 7 ] can happen { It  }  [ 7 ] should happen and then it 's going happen under more than those exceptional circumstances. It 's going to start becoming the regular rather than the unusual. Professor Yoo let me bring you in here um. What do you think about { Professor Dershowitz  }  [ 8 ] 's argument that torture under any circumstances is wrong uh and that { he  }  [ 8 ] supports { the McCain amendment  }  [ 10 ] { McCain  }  [ 9 ] amendment uh but at the president 's direction uh under extraordinary circumstances. I agree with much of what Alan says. I do think torture is wrong. it 's illegal. What { the McCain amendment  }  [ 10 ] { McCain  }  [ 9 ] amendment is just repeating is the Geneva convention standard that already applies in Iraq. what the problem with { the McCain amendment  }  [ 10 ] { McCain  }  [ 9 ] amendment is , that { it  }  [ 10 ] prevents the CIA to use interrogation methods would not be torture but would fall under this vaguer term cruel inhumane degrading treatment which is. But what is your definition of torture? I mean uh I understand you were one of the lawyers in the justice department early on who helped craft documents outlining you know what some called a before { nine eleven  }  [ 11 ] approach and after { nine eleven  }  [ 11 ] approach. And the definition of torture uh that I understand from what I 've read that you were advocating was a very narrow one. look. we can all have an argument where exactly { that line  }  [ 12 ] is. and I think { it  }  [ 12 ] means severe pain and suffering either physical or mental can not be imposed. That would be torture. See. I would have a broader definition of torture. I would define { it  }  [ 13 ] very broadly then prohibit { it }  [ 13 ]  But then if { it  }  [ 13 ] 's felt necessary to use any of these measures short of torture water boarding extreme psychological measures if { the president of the United States  }  [ 14 ] { the United States  }  [ 15 ] is prepared to put { his  }  [ 14 ] credibility on the line and say the future of { the nation  }  [ 15 ] is stake { we  }  [ 15 ] must violate the law in this instance like { we  }  [ 15 ] would if { we  }  [ 15 ] had to shoot down a civilian airliner let { the president  }  [ 14 ] take accountability. And that would broaden the definition of torture. { It  }  [ 16 ] would n't have any of these escape valves that we now have and would place accountability squarely where { it  }  [ 16 ] belongs not on the shoulders of sergeant England or some other low ranking official. right now you 're just being an apologist for torture. Oh come on. stop throwing around words like that. uh let me please finish. I mean that 's just insulting to the intelligence of the audience. Look. let me finish. You know that? Let me talk. and then you can answer. Yeah. Okay? you know better than that. what 's your point? my point is this that torture is new in the American discourse in many ways. { We  }  [ 15 ] have not seen the prevalence , we have not seen an outcropping of torture notwithstanding all of the wars in which we 've engaged until this current administration. Totally false. totally false. it was rampant in { the second world war }  [ 17 ]  rampant. And please. I mean but is n't it true that there has always been torture? Always. There always has but not in the degree not in the level not in the amount that { we  }  [ 18 ] have seen. Much worse. much worse. And the fact is that by saying that { we  }  [ 18 ] are going to allow certain circumstances under which { we  }  [ 18 ] will apologize for torture - Much worse in { the Vietnam war }  [ 17 ]  much worse in { the Korean war }  [ 17 ]  much worse. I ca n't talk without me. All right you 're saying it 's been much worse. Much worse. Professor Yoo eh { President Bush  }  [ 19 ] says { the US  }  [ 18 ] does not torture. Do you believe that 's true? Yeah I believe it 's not true , that if { there is abuses like Abu Ghraib occuring  }  [ 20 ] { they  }  [ 20 ] 're just illegal and ought to be punished. Professor Dershowitz does the US torture? Of course { it  }  [ 18 ] does. and { it  }  [ 18 ] does with a wink and a nod from the president of { the United States  }  [ 18 ] from the secretary of defense from { the vice president }  [ 19 ]  Just the message { he  }  [ 19 ] gave yesterday { we  }  [ 21 ] do n't approve torture but { we  }  [ 21 ] approve doing whatever is necessary to stop terrorism. And that sends a mixed message. Bill let me uh tell you something that { Senator Roberts  }  [ 22 ] has said about the McCain amendment. { He  }  [ 22 ] says and I 'm paraphrasing that basically the element of surprise what { the enemy  }  [ 23 ] does not know about what we 're going to do to { them  }  [ 23 ] \",\n"," \"Still ahead on Three Sixty .

The two biggest races the races for the governorships of { Virginia  }  [ 7 ] and { New Jersey }  [ 8 ]  Democrats winning in both of those states we can show you here. { CNN  }  [ 4 ] projecting that Tim Kaine now the lieutenant governor will be the next governor of { Virginia  }  [ 7 ] winning quite handily fifty - two to forty - six percent over republican Jerry Kilgore. Also in { the state of New Jersey John Corzine  }  [ 9 ] { New Jersey  }  [ 8 ] John Corzine the democrat with fifty - four percent of the vote right now beating Doug Forrester the republican just forty - three percent. Ninety - one percent of the vote counted in { New Jersey }  [ 8 ]  Ninety - nine percent of the vote counted now in { Virginia }  [ 7 ]  Two democratic victories in the races for governor. Republican Michael Bloomberg will win re-election in { New York }  [ 9 ]  Republicans will celebrate that. That a source of frustration to democrats . How much does this mean nationally ? That race in { New Jeresey  }  [ 9 ] was much more personally nasty about property taxes perhaps than about President Bush or any national issues. { The Virginia race about the death penalty about other state issues as well traffic number one among them }  [ 10 ] { the death penalty about other state issues  }  [ 11 ] as well traffic number one among { them }  [ 11 ]  But the democrats will certainly that { the Virginia race  }  [ 10 ] { Virginia  }  [ 7 ] race is proof that the republican base is demoralized.
